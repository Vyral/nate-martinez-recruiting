Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…it’s the last day of 2018, which means there is still a small window of time to mark off your list, hit that final goal or connect with a long-lost friend or family member. As we close the chapter on another year, I wanted to share the lyrics to Elton John’s song The Circle of Life, which is perfect timing for today’s message. Let's welcome the New Year by celebrating the circle… and miracle of life! Let’s make it a great week!![](/uploads/181226-newyear-fbgraphic-v1.png)

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

The Circle of Life (Music by Elton John, Lyrics by Tim Rice, From the soundtrack of "The Lion King”)

From the day we arrive on the planet<br>And blinking, step into the sun<br>There's more to see than can ever be seen<br>More to do than can ever be done

There's far too much to take in here<br>More to find than can ever be found<br>But the sun rolling high<br>Through the sapphire sky<br>Keeps great and small on the endless round

It's the circle of life<br>And it moves us all<br>Through despair and hope<br>Through faith and love

Till we find our place<br>On the path unwinding<br>In the circle<br>The circle of life

It's the circle of life<br>And it moves us all<br>Through despair and hope<br>Through faith and love

Till we find our place<br>On the path unwinding<br>In the circle<br>The circle of life

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

The new year stands before us, like a chapter in a book, waiting to be written. We can help write that story by setting goals. Melody Beattie

And now we welcome the new year. Full of things that have never been. Rainer Maria Rilke

Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. Oprah Winfrey
