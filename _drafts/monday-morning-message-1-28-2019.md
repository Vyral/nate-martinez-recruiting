Welcome to this edition of Nate's Monday Message! I hope you all had a fantastic weekend and were able to spend quality time with your family and friends. We all work hard, and we are often times so dedicated to our careers that we forget to enjoy the little things. We need to find time every day, every week to celebrate the small things that make a difference both at work and at home. Let us remember that we don’t live to work, but rather work to live!

This week, let’s commit to our family and friends; to the people we love. If we don’t make them a priority, then what is it that we are working towards? Priorities are the people and things we place value on. What are yours? Decide. Commit. Then do. Let’s make it a great week!

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Don't wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it's at work or with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed and savored.” - Earl Nightingale

“Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness.” - John C. Maxwell

“To enjoy good health, to bring true happiness to one's family, to bring peace to all, one must first discipline and control one's own mind. If a man can control his mind he can find the way to Enlightenment, and all wisdom and virtue will naturally come to him.” - Buddha
