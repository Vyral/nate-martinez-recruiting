Welcome to this edition of Nate's Monday Message. I had the pleasure of hearing author [Mark Sanborn](https://marksanborn.com/) speak this last week at the Leverage ’19 real estate event in Scottsdale. He talked about an acronym he developed to help us stay on track with our goals. I want to share that with you today…

**F.I.T. which stands for frequency, intensity and technique.**

Successful people do the things that they need to do to produce the results every single day (frequency). They also give 110% of their effort (intensity) and they use the right technique. The definition of insanity is doing the same over and over again and expecting a different result. Focusing on the right technique is vital, combined with frequency and intensity. F.I.T. can be applied to anything you want to accomplish, including that list of New Year’s Resolutions you wrote down such as losing weight, saving more money or spending more time with family and friends. How can you apply F.I.T. to your life? Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Focus: The 5%/95% Rule

Focus 5% on what you fear 95% on getting educated and skilled to face it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Focus 5% on the problem 95% on the healthiest solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Focus 5% on the mistake 95% on learning from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Focus 5% on who to blame 95% on making sure to heal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Focus 5% on what you must do 95% on enjoying the process of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Focus 5% on the conflict 95% on the win-win-win resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Focus 5% on what you can't control 95% on what you do have control over.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Focus 5% on what others say 95% on what you believe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Focus 5% on what you have 95% on what you want to have.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Focus 5% on reading this 95% on applying it.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Successful people maintain a positive focus in life no matter what is going on around them. They stay focused on their past successes rather than their past failures, and on the next action steps they need to take to get them closer to the fulfillment of their goals rather than all the other distractions that life presents to them.” - Jack Canfield

“I don't focus on what I'm up against. I focus on my goals and I try to ignore the rest.” - Venus Williams

“Give yourself a gift of five minutes of contemplation in awe of everything you see around you. Go outside and turn your attention to the many miracles around you. This five-minute-a-day regimen of appreciation and gratitude will help you to focus your life in awe.” - Wayne Dyer
