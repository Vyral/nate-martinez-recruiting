**Nate’s Monday Morning Message**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate's Monday Message! We spend a lot of time thinking about all the things we need to fix or improve in our lives. However, what amount of time do we spend being proud of what we have accomplished so far, or feeling thankful for the blessings we currently have? Let us focus some of our attention on those items this week and every week going forward. True, we must work hard, but we also need to look at how far we’ve come, and smile. Life is a journey of experiences! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

My Dog Can Walk on Water

There was a hunter who came into the possession of a special bird dog. The dog was the only one of its kind, because it can walk on water. One day he invited a friend to go hunting with him so that he could show off his prized possession. After some time, they shot a few ducks, which fell into the river. The man ordered his dog to run and fetch the birds. The dog ran on water to fetch the birds. The man was expecting a compliment about the amazing dog but did not receive it. Being curious, he asked his friend if the friend had noticed anything unusual about the dog. The friend replied, “Yes, I did see something unusual about your dog. Your dog can’t swim!”

Moral of the story: More than 90 percent of the people that we face every day are negative. They choose to look at the hole in the middle rather than the doughnut. Do not expect compliments or encouragement from them. These are the people who cannot pull you out of your present situation. They can only push you down. So be aware of them, spend less time with them, and do not let them steal your dreams away from you.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Appreciation is a wonderful thing: It makes what is excellent in others belong to us as well.” - Voltaire

“A healthy attitude is contagious but don't wait to catch it from others. Be a carrier.” - Tom Stoppard

“When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around.” - Willie Nelson

“Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend.” - Melody Beattie
