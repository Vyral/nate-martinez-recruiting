## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,023**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! Its August 31st and that means it is the last day of the Month of Miracles\! I want to thank each of you who generously donated this month to our goal of $20,000 to benefit our beloved Phoenix Children’s Hospital. In these uncertain times, I know some of you might be struggling financially and that is one of the reasons why this year was so important for us to fundraise. The hospital has moved quickly to adapt to the new needs of sick kids and their families, and we were able to assist with those demands by our donations – THANK YOU\! As you go through this week, I’d like you to look for ways that you can make a difference – its not always about donating pennies, but maybe it’s a warm smile to a stranger, a long over due phone call, or helping your neighbor. What we give makes a difference. Let’s make it a great week\!

**PS** We have one more fundraising opportunity going on through today. We have three awesome raffle items up for grabs and all you have to do is post a comment with your bid amount and we’ll announce the winners on the 31st.

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Believing in You, By Catherine Pulsifer

Never stop believing in yourself.&nbsp;<br>When others doubt, don't you.&nbsp;

Do what you love to do,&nbsp;<br>No one knows better than you.

Life is too short to live others' dreams&nbsp;<br>Follow your own dream&nbsp;

Push yourself to reach your goals&nbsp;<br>And live the life you once dreamed.

Trust your instincts.&nbsp;<br>Be true to yourself.&nbsp;

You know what is right for you.&nbsp;<br>Never give up or give in.

Forget the words "I don't know how."&nbsp;<br>You can learn, you can research, you can do.

Your mind is powerful.&nbsp;<br>When you believe you can.&nbsp;

You will find a way&nbsp;<br>You won't waste a day.

Persist and persevere.&nbsp;<br>Do not fear Because if you believe in you&nbsp;

You will find dreams can come true.<br>May all your dreams turn into goals,&nbsp;<br>Believe in yourself.&nbsp;

And remember, all of life is a choice.&nbsp;<br>The decision is up to you.

Believe in Yourself,<br>Dare to be whatever you want to be\!
