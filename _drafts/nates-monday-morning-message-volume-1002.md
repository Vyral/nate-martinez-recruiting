## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,002**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…as we prepare ourselves for another week of sheltering in place, let’s keep in mind that how we choose to spend our time is completely up to us, and many of us have a few extra hours in the day which we are not used to having available. Despite the uncertainty, we can still choose to be in a positive mood, or we can choose not to. We can still choose to focus on the things in our lives that we have control over, or we can choose not to. There are very few things we truly have control over, but what you do have control over is your attitude and your actions. The beauty about life, is that it’s all up to us. My offer still stands that any of you reading this who might need help getting essentials, please give me a call directly. We will get through this as a community – and come back even stronger as a nation\! Let’s make it a great week\! &nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

We shall do much in the years to come,<br>But what have we done today?

We shall give out gold in a princely sum,<br>But what did we give today?

We shall lift the heart and dry the tear,<br>We shall plant a hope in the place of fear,

We shall speak the words of love and cheer,<br>But what did we speak today?

We shall be so kind in the after while,<br>But what have we done today?

We shall bring to each lonely life a smile,<br>But what have we brought today?

We shall give to truth a grander birth,<br>And to steadfast faith a deeper worth,

We shall feed the hungering souls of earth,<br>But whom have we fed today?

We shall reap such joys in the by and by,<br>But what have we sown today?

We shall build us mansions in the sky,<br>But what have we built today?&nbsp;

\`Tis sweet in the idle dreams to bask;<br>But here and now, do we our task?

Yet, this is the thing our souls must ask,<br>What have we done today?

“When I look into the future, it's so bright it burns my eyes.” – Oprah Winfrey

“Just as despair can come to one only from other human beings, hope, too, can be given to one only by other human beings.” – Elie Wiesel
