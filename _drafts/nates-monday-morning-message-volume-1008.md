## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,008**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…I hope this email finds each of you healthy and safe. During preparation of writing this email to you today, I found the writing below which I felt inspired to share, as it is timely given the current circumstances, we are all facing during this time. I hope that it will inspire your day, this week and the weeks that follow. Let’s make it a great week\!&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Beginning Today, Author Unknown

Beginning today I will no longer worry about yesterday.It is in the past and the past will never change.Only I can change by choosing to do so.

Beginning today I will no longer worry about tomorrow.Tomorrow will always be there, waiting for me to make the most of it.But I cannot make the most of tomorrow without firstmaking the most of today.

Beginning today I will look in the mirror and I will see a person worthy of my respect and admiration.This capable person looking back at me is someone I enjoy spending timewith and someone I would like to get to know better.

Beginning today I will cherish each moment of my life.I value this gift bestowed upon me in this world and I will unselfishlyshare this gift with others.I will use this gift to enhance the lives of others.

Beginning today I will take a moment to step off the beaten path and torevel in the mysteries I encounter.I will face challenges with courage and determination.I will overcome what barriers there may be which hinder my quest for growth and self-improvement.

Beginning today I will take life one day at a time, one step at a time.Discouragement will not be allowed to taint my positive self-image,my desire to succeed or my capacity to love.

Beginning today I walk with renewed faith in human kindness.Regardless of what has gone before, I believe there is hopefor a brighter and better future.

Beginning today I will open my mind and my heart.I will welcome new experiences. I will meet new people.I will not expect perfection from myself nor anyone else: perfection does not exist in an imperfect world.But I will applaud the attempt to overcome human foibles.

Beginning today I am responsible for my own happiness and I will do things that make me happy . . .admire the beautiful wonders of nature, listen to my favorite music,pet a kitten or a puppy, soak in a bubble bath . . .pleasure can be found in the most simple of gestures.

Beginning today I will learn something new; I will try something different; I will savor all the various flavors life has to offer.I will change what I can and the rest I will let go.I will strive to become the best me I can possibly be.

Beginning today. And every day.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.” – Steve Jobs

“One isn't necessarily born with courage, but one is born with potential. Without courage, we cannot practice any other virtue with consistency. We can't be kind, true, merciful, generous, or honest.” –Maya Angelou

“Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.” – Dale Carnegie
