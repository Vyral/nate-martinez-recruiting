## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,009**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…did you know that each Memorial Day a moment of remembrance takes place at 3pm local time? It is unclear where the tradition originated but what a great way to truly remember those who sacrificed their lives for our freedoms. I have a tremendous amount of respect for all our armed forces, for their dedication and commitment to our great country. I know this Memorial Day may not look like past celebrations with family and friends, but I hope you will take a moment at 3pm today to honor the fallen men and women who represent the great USA. Let’s make it a great week\!&nbsp;&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

We Honor You Today &copy; Susan R. Smith

To all of our veterans<br>Far and near.<br>We thank you for your service<br>For all those years.

You sacrificed your time,<br>And some gave your life.<br>You preserved our freedom<br>By willingly paying the price.

Many of you<br>Were sent overseas.<br>You were wounded in battle<br>With scars and disease.<br>But courageous and brave,<br>You weathered the storm.

You faced every battle<br>With faith and beyond.<br>We honor you with joy<br>For all that you've done.<br>You stood strong for our country,<br>For our daughters and sons.

So no one stands alone,<br>We walk hand in hand.<br>Remember, we are with you.<br>Together we shall stand.<br>We salute you today.

Hear what we say.<br>Let our words speak eloquently<br>In this special way.<br><br>On this day,<br>Let us express our love and thanks<br>For the sacrifice you paid.<br>You served in honor<br>For many years and days,<br>And we will never forget<br>How you were strong and brave.
