## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,011**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…the events that have unfolded over the past few days have been heavy and complex, but I believe that something positive will come from all the unrest. I don’t want to use this platform to discuss the issues happening in our city and across the nation, however I do want to encourage each of you to listen, and use your voice to be a part of the change. Life is precious and I have been reminded that every time I hold my now week-old grandson. I am reminded that love is a powerful emotion and my tiny grandson has filled my heart with a love that I can’t explain. With that being said, to each of you reading this, I am sending you a little bit of that love in hopes that it will carry us through these uncertain times – and I hope that you will pass it on. Let’s make it a great week\!&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

**It Is Up to Me**

*I woke up early today, excited over all I get to do before the clock strikes midnight.*

*I have responsibilities to fulfill today.*

*I am important. My job is to choose what kind of day I am going to have.*

*Today I can complain because the weather is rainy, or I can be thankful that the grass is getting watered for free.*

*Today I can feel sad that I don't have more money, or I can be glad that my finances encourage me to plan my purchases wisely and guide me away from waste.*

*Today I can grumble about my health or I can rejoice that I am alive.*

*Today I can lament over all that my parents didn't give me when I was growing up or I can feel grateful that they allowed me to be born.*

*Today I can cry because roses have thorns, or I can celebrate that thorns have roses.*

*Today I can mourn my lack of friends or I can excitedly embark upon a quest to discover new relationships.*

*Today I can whine because I have to go to work or I can shout for joy because I have a job to do.*

*Today I can complain because I have to go to school or eagerly open my mind and fill it with rich new tidbits of knowledge.*

*Today I can murmur dejectedly because I have to do housework, or I can feel honored because the Lord has provided shelter for my mind, body, and soul.*

*Today stretches ahead of me, waiting to be shaped, and I am the sculptor who gets to do the shaping.*

*Today, my attitude is the difference. I get to choose what kind of day I will have\! It is up to me. *
