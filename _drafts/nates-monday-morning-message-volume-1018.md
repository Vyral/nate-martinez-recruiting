## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,018**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! Throughout the month of August RE/MAX's corporate office and agents across the U.S. and Canada will participate in a variety of activities designed to bring awareness to the need children's hospital have for donations. As many of you know, our office and agents are heavily involved in supporting our local Phoenix Children’s Hospital, and **we have raised more than $500,000 since 2001**.

We considered not hosting the Month of Miracles this year due to the pandemic, however the sick kids being treated at PCH has not stopped because of Covid-19. Last year we raised over $22,000 and we will continue the goal of **Two Million Pennies** this year, however its going to look a little different. Instead of hosting a series of Friday events to fund raise, we are taking it to a virtual setting and we are excited to announce our first ever streaming live concert with local talent, Throwing Fitz (big thank you to our very own Rick Ramirez who offered to share his band’s talents with us\!).

Please mark your calendar for **Friday, August 14th at 5pm**. Because this is virtual, we would also like you to extend the invitation to your family, friends and anyone who might enjoy a fun filled evening of music right from the comfort of their home\! We will be fundraising throughout the concert and may even have some raffle prizes for the top donors. Please keep your eye out for the details on the virtual event coming soon. Let’s make it a great week\!&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Thank you for the gift of life,<br>For letting me be me,<br>For all that I can know by words<br>And all that I can see.

For all the music I can hear<br>And all the songs I sing,<br>For all the joy that comes to me<br>And all the joy I bring.

For all the food that I can taste<br>And all the sweet scents smell,<br>For all the loved one I can touch,<br>Who love and wish me well.

For all the beauty of the world,<br>Ever fresh and new,<br>I don’t know who else I can thank,<br>And so I’m thanking you.

Written by Nicholas Gordon
