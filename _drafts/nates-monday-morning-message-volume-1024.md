**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

It Couldn’t Be Done by Edgar Guest

Somebody said it couldn't be done,<br>But he with a chuckle replied<br>That "maybe it couldn't," but he would be one<br>Who wouldn't say so till he'd tried.<br>So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin<br>On his face. If he worried he hid it.<br>He started to sing and he tackled the thing<br>That couldn't be done, and he did it.

Somebody scoffed: "Oh, you'll never do that;<br>At least no one has ever done it";<br>But he took off his coat and he took of his hat,<br>And the first thing we knew he'd begun it.<br>With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,<br>Without any doubting or quiddit,<br>He started to sing and he tackled the thing<br>That couldn't be done, and he did it.

There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,<br>There are thousands to prophesy failure;<br>There are thousands to point out to you, one by one,<br>The dangers that wait to assail you.<br>But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,<br>Just take off your coat and go to it;Just start to sing as you tackle the thing<br>That "cannot be done," and you'll do it.
