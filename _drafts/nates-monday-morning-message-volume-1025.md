## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,025**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! I hope each of you reading this had a restful weekend and that you are ready to tackle another week. Fortunately, it looks like the cooler temps are on their way\! And let’s send our friends in the PacWest good vibes for low winds and some much-needed rain to help the firefighters battle the flames. Our thoughts are with all of those impacted by the wildfires\!

As we approach Q4 of 2020, I’d like to challenge you to revisit your goals and aspirations for this year – what have you done so far? What can you still do in the remaining weeks? What goals need to be revised and refreshed? Every day we have a unique opportunity – let’s not waste it\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

The King's Roadblock, Author unknown.

In ancient times, a king had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock.

Some of the king's wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it. Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about getting the big stone out of the way.

Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables. On approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded.

As the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway.

The peasant learned what many others never understand: Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve one's condition once you make the effort.

“Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.” - Mahatma Gandhi

“Always Do Your Best. Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret.” - Don Miguel Ruiz
