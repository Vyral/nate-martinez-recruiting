## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,027**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! I hope that you had a wonderful weekend, filled with whatever activities that bring you joy and an opportunity to rest and relax in preparation for the new week. While the temperatures are continuing to set new records, the mornings here in the desert have been a long-awaited breath of fresh, cooler air. I hope you have enjoyed a little more time outside this last week\!

The last quarter of 2020 starts this week – are you ready? Last week we talked about taking inventory of this year so far, and this week I’d like to encourage you to think about the last few weeks of the year. What would it take to make them the best they can be? What goals can you still accomplish in the next 90 days? There is still time – make it count. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

A professor of philosophy came into his class. He brought some items with him and put them on the table. When the class began, he took a large transparent empty jar and started to fill it with rather massive stones. Then the professor asked his students: “Is the jar full?” They confirmed that it was.

Now the professor picked up a box of small pebbles, poured them into the jar and shook it, so that pebbles filled the open areas between the rocks. He asked once again: “Is the jar full?” They agreed that it was.

This time the professor poured a bucket of sand into the jar, and the sand filled up everything else.

“Now,“ said the professor, “I want you to see that this jar is just like your life – the stones are the most important things, your main values – your family, health, morality.

The pebbles are other things that matter – your job, house and car. The sand represents the small stuff.

So, if you put the sand into the jar first, there would be no place left for pebbles and large stones. Therefore pay most of your attention to the things, that are the most important in life – spend enough time with your family, take care of your health and don‘t forget to develop spiritually – be kind, honest, sensitive, helpful. These are the things that really matter. They should be your priorities. The rest is just sand.”

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“When we are no longer able to change a situation - we are challenged to change ourselves.” - Viktor E. Frankl

“Let us not be satisfied with just giving money. Money is not enough, money can be got, but they need your hearts to love them. So, spread your love everywhere you go.” – Mother Teresa

“They might not need me; but they might. I'll let my head be just in sight; a smile as small as mine might be precisely their necessity.” - Emily Dickinson
