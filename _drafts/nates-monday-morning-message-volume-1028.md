## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,028**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you well and ready to take on another fresh and new week – and perhaps we have seen the last of the triple digits here in the Valley of the Sun\! This week I’d like to challenge each of you to think about one thing you can do to make a difference in your life, in your family’s life, in your community, in your business. Amid the chaos and stress of day to day life, what is one thing you can do to bring a little joy and happiness? What is just one thing that leaves the world a better place? Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Just One - Unknown

One song can spark a moment,<br>One flower can wake the dream<br>One tree can start a forest, One bird can herald spring.<br>One smile begins a friendship,<br>One handclasp lifts a soul.<br>One star can guide a ship at sea,<br>One word can frame the goal<br>One vote can change a nation, one sunbeam lights a room<br>One candle wipes out darkness,<br>One laugh will conquer gloom.<br>One step must start each journey.<br>One word must start each prayer.<br>One hope will raise our spirits,<br>One touch can show you care.<br>One voice can speak with wisdom,<br>One heart can know what's true,<br>One life can make a difference,<br>You see, it's up to you\!
