## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,036**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! I trust that each of you reading this had a relaxing, safe and healthy holiday weekend. We are on the final stretch of 2020 and I know for many of us, we can’t wait to put 2020 behind us\! However, as we are navigating the pandemic, we are also facing a stressful time of year for many – the holiday season – and this year, we can agree it will look a lot different despite our creative and unique ideas to keep our annual traditions. This week, I’d like to encourage you to take a deep breath and remember that kindness and compassion go a long way. As always, let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Paid in Full With a Glass of Milk, a true Story of Kindness

The year was 1863 and one day, a poor boy by the name of Howard Kelly was selling goods door to door to pay his way through school. After a full day of working hard he figured he had only a little bit of change left, but to little to get some food. Like many days before he had been hungry for the most part of the day. He hoped to make at least some sales to get enough money for food and to put some money on the side for his tuition next year. After going through some scenarios in his mind he was hoping for some kindness from the people living in the next house where he decided to ask for a meal. As he approached the door and rang the bell he was determined to not only ask for food but to make a sale at the end.

However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. So instead of a meal, he asked for a glass of water. The woman remembered seeing this young boy many times working hard going up and down the streets knocking on doors. Almost everyone in the neighborhood knew his story and that many times instead of selling to people he helped them with their chores. She thought he looked hungry so she brought him a large glass of milk instead of water. The boy drank it slowly and then asked how much he owes.

“You don’t owe me anything,” she replied. “I know you helped many people in our neighborhood. Mother has taught us that kindness is repaid with kindness.” You could see a bit of relief and happiness as he replied, “Then I thank you from my heart.” Right there and then Howard felt stronger and more confident as he found some hope in the kind actions of the young woman. He continued on with his work feeling recharged by a mear smile, some words and a full glass of milk.

Year’s later that young woman became critically ill. The local doctors were baffled. They finally sent her to the big city, where they called in specialists to study her rare disease. Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation. When he heard the name of the town she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. Immediately he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room.

Dressed in his doctor’s gown he went in to see her. He recognized her at once and remembered the kindness she showed him that day and how much that helped him. He went back to the consultation room determined to do his best to save her life. From that day he gave special attention to the case. After a long struggle, the battle was won. Dr. Howard requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the edge and the bill was sent to her room.

She feared to open it, for she was sure it would take the rest of her life to pay for it all. Finally, she looked, and something caught her attention on the side of the bill. She began to read the following words, “PAID IN FULL WITH ONE GLASS OF MILK. SIGNED, DR. Howard Kelly.”
