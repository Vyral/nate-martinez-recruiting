## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 979**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…are you aware of the tremendous influence you have in this amazing world we live in?

You have the ability to make someone’s day. You can make someone smile or laugh - today. You can help someone with a problem or difficult situation - today. You can be the person that is always helpful, always encouraging, always thought of as someone people want to be around.&nbsp;

Let's take some time today and this week to really focus on truly helping others on a regular basis. You will feel great about it and that help will come back to you when needed. Let's take the time to slow down and pay attention to what it is that we can do rather than focusing on what we don't have control over. You have control over what you do, right now, and how you do it. Remember we must always give before we get. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Just One - Unknown

One song can spark a moment, One flower can wake the dreamOne tree can start a forest, One bird can herald spring.One smile begins a friendship, One handclasp lifts a soul.One star can guide a ship at sea, One word can frame the goalOne vote can change a nation, one sunbeam lights a roomOne candle wipes out darkness, One laugh will conquer gloom.One step must start each journey. One word must start each prayer.One hope will raise our spirits, One touch can show you care.One voice can speak with wisdom, One heart can know what's true,One life can make a difference, You see, it's up to you\!

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“If human beings had genuine courage, they'd wear their costumes every day of the year, not just on Halloween.” - Douglas Coupland

**“**The great thing about candy is that it can't be spoiled by the adult world. Candy is innocent. And all Halloween candy pales next to candy corn, if only because candy corn used to appear, like the Great Pumpkin, solely on Halloween.” - Rosecrans Baldwin

“Halloween is one day of breaking out of your shell, one day you can be completely expressive, where the world gives you license to dress up.” - Chris March
