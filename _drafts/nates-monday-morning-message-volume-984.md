## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 984**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…I hope that each of you reading this had a lovely Thanksgiving celebration and that you were able to spend memorable time with those you cherish the most. And now the holiday season is upon us\! This can be a wonderful time of year, however it can also be a very stressful.

Before you get swept away with the hustle and the bustle, I hope you will implement a bit of self-care. Remember what they tell you while preparing to take flight…you must put your airbag on first before assisting others around you. If you don’t take care of yourself first, especially during this time of year, then you can’t be there for your family and friends\! Let’s make it a great week\!
