## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 987**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…I read an article by motivational speaker and teacher,&nbsp;[Darren Hardy](https://www.facebook.com/DarrenHardyFan){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;that has inspired me this holiday season. Every year during the holidays, we get into the *“**giving season**.”* We see a rush on donations for toys, food and other worthy causes, which is great but what if we were in the *“**giving season**”* every day – not just the last few weeks of the year? What if we applied the *“**giving season**”* to more than just donations and holiday gifts?

“Want courage? Give encouragement. Want hope? Give hope. Want love? Give love. Want success? Help someone else become successful.” – Darren Hardy

We are presented with little opportunities on a daily basis to make a difference, just by giving whatever you can in that moment. Giving isn’t about money or fancy gifts; the simple gesture of a kind smile to a stranger can be the best gift of all. And the gifts we give that come from the heart, are what the holiday season is truly about. My wish for you, this year and throughout the New Year is to be in the “*giving season**”* every day. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house

Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;

The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,

In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;

The children were nestled all snug in their beds;

While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;

And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,

Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,

I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.

Away to the window I flew like a flash,

Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,

Gave a lustre of midday to objects below,

When what to my wondering eyes did appear,

But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer,

With a little old driver so lively and quick,

I knew in a moment he must be St. Nick.

More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,

And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:

"Now,&nbsp;*Dasher*\! now,&nbsp;*Dancer*\! now&nbsp;*Prancer*&nbsp;and&nbsp;*Vixen*\!

On,&nbsp;*Comet*\! on,&nbsp;*Cupid*\! on,&nbsp;*Donner*&nbsp;and&nbsp;*Blitzen*\!

To the top of the porch\! to the top of the wall\!

Now dash away\! dash away\! dash away all\!"

As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,

When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;

So up to the housetop the coursers they flew

With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too—

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof

The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.

As I drew in my head, and was turning around,

Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,

And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;

A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,

And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.

His eyes—how they twinkled\! his dimples, how merry\!

His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry\!

His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,

And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,

And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath;

He had a broad face and a little round belly

That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,

And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;

A wink of his eye and a twist of his head

Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,

And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,

And laying his finger aside of his nose,

And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,

And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.

But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight—

“Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night\!”

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“For it is in giving that we receive.” - Francis of Assisi

“Christmas is not a time nor a season, but a state of mind. To cherish peace and goodwill, to be plenteous in mercy, is to have the real spirit of Christmas.” – Calvin Coolidge

“Christmas is a season for kindling the fire for hospitality in the hall, the genial flame of charity in the heart.” - Washington Irving
