## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 991**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! I trust that this email has found you well-rested from the weekend and perhaps enjoying an extra day off as we honor history and the man who fought for change, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The world is full of visionaries and changers of history and as a community, a country, a great big world, we need those individuals who are brave enough to face adversity for the betterment of the collective whole. Standing up for what you believe in, it’s always easy and today, we should let the legacy of Dr. King be a reminder – to never give up on a dream. &nbsp;Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Where we place our focus, the rest of our mind and emotions will follow. So how do we learn how to do this focus stuff? One of the quickest ways to begin to strengthen your focus muscles is to practice the 5%/95% rule. That means to focus no more than 5% on what you don't want and 95% on what you do want.

Focus 5% on what you fear 95 % on getting educated and skilled to face it.

Focus 5% on the problem 95% on the healthiest solution.

Focus 5% on the mistake 95 % on learning from it.

Focus 5% on who to blame 95% on making sure to heal.

Focus 5% on what you must do 95% on enjoying the process of it.

Focus 5% on the conflict 95% on the win-win-win resolution.

Focus 5% on what you can't control 95% on what you do have control over.

Focus 5% on what others say 95% on what you believe.

Focus 5% on what you have 95% on what you want to have.

Focus 5% on reading this 95% on applying it.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” – Martin Luther King, Jr.

“Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase.” – Martin Luther King, Jr.

“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” – Martin Luther King, Jr.

“The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.” – Martin Luther King, Jr.
