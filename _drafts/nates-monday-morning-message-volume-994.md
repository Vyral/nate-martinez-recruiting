## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 994**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…this week I wanted to talk about happiness. Many of us do not spend that much time thinking about our own happiness. We go about our day just looking to do whatever we can to get to the next day. When we do think about happiness it is mostly about how we can make the people around us happier. I would suggest to you that true happiness is contagious. If you are happy with who you are, the things you are doing, and the way you are doing them, you will certainly be in a better place to make others happy.

This week let’s take some time to focus on happiness and how to create more of it in your life. When you are happier, the people around you will be too. When you are happier, your situation looks better. When you are happier, great things happen. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Wishing&nbsp;

Do you wish the World were better? Let me tell you what to do:&nbsp;

Set a watch upon your actions, Keep them always straight and true. Rid your mind of selfish motives, Let your thoughts be clean and high. You can make a little Eden Of the sphere you occupy.&nbsp;

Do you wish the World were wiser? Then suppose you make a start,&nbsp;

By accumulating wisdom In the scrap book of your heart. Do not waste one page on folly; Live to learn and learn to live. If you want to give men knowledge You must get it ere you give.&nbsp;

Do you wish the World were happy? Then remember day by day,&nbsp;

Just to scatter seeds of kindness, As you pass along the way. For the pleasures of the many, May be oft times traced to one. As the hand that plants an acorn, Shelters armies from the sun.&nbsp;

Poet: Ella Wheeler Wilcox&nbsp;
