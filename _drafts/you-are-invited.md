**Nate’s Monday Morning Message**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate's Monday Message! Today I am excited to personally invite you to a special event we are hosting on Wednesday with self-made millionaire and motivational speaker, Rock Thomas. I have known Rock for a few years now, and it is a privilege to have him share his is **Sunday System for Success** (this presentation is valued at $297.00 per ticket). He's run several successful businesses, six award-winning RE/MAX franchises, sold countless best-selling books and created life-changing programs that help people turn ideas into action and action into success.&nbsp;

You don’t have to be in real estate to benefit from his presentation, meaning that this invitation is open to anyone who is committed to self-mastery, so please share it with your friends and family!

We will be providing lunch and everyone who attends will receive a planner which is valued at $39.00. You can register to attend by [clicking here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rock-thomas-sunday-system-for-success-tickets-58398329977). I hope you will join us on Wednesday, March 27th at 11am! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

THE BEAUTY OF MATHEMATICS

BE sure to read to the END...Just the math part is good enough, the end is even better.&nbsp;

1 x 8 + 1 = 9 12 x 8 + 2 = 98&nbsp;<br>123 x 8 + 3 = 987&nbsp;<br>1234 x 8 + 4 = 9876&nbsp;<br>12345 x 8 + 5 = 98765&nbsp;<br>123456 x 8 + 6 = 987654&nbsp;<br>1234567 x 8 + 7 = 9876543&nbsp;<br>12345678 x 8 + 8 = 98765432&nbsp;<br>123456789 x 8 + 9 = 987654321 &nbsp;

1 x 9 + 2 = 11&nbsp;<br>12 x 9 + 3 = 111&nbsp;<br>123 x 9 + 4 = 1111&nbsp;<br>1234 x 9 + 5 = 11111&nbsp;<br>12345 x 9 + 6 = 111111&nbsp;<br>123456 x 9 + 7 = 1111111&nbsp;<br>1234567 x 9 + 8 = 11111111&nbsp;<br>12345678 x 9 + 9 = 111111111&nbsp;<br>123456789 x 9 +10= 1111111111 &nbsp;

9 x 9 + 7 = 88&nbsp;<br>98 x 9 + 6 = 888&nbsp;<br>987 x 9 + 5 = 8888&nbsp;<br>9876 x 9 + 4 = 88888&nbsp;<br>98765 x 9 + 3 = 888888&nbsp;<br>987654 x 9 + 2 = 8888888&nbsp;<br>9876543 x 9 + 1 = 88888888&nbsp;<br>98765432 x 9 + 0 = 888888888 &nbsp;

1 x 1 = 1&nbsp;<br>11 x 11 = 121&nbsp;<br>111 x 111 = 12321&nbsp;<br>1111 x 1111 = 1234321&nbsp;<br>11111 x 11111 = 123454321&nbsp;<br>111111 x 111111 = 12345654321&nbsp;<br>1111111 x 1111111 = 1234567654321&nbsp;<br>11111111 x 11111111 = 123456787654321&nbsp;<br>111111111 x 111111111 = 12345678987654321 &nbsp;

Mind Boggling... Now, take a look at this...&nbsp;

From a strictly mathematical viewpoint:&nbsp;<br>What Equals 100%? What does it mean to give MORE than 100%? &nbsp;

Here's a little mathematical formula that might help answer these questions: &nbsp;

If: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z &nbsp;Is represented as: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26. &nbsp;

Then: H-A-R-D-W-O- R- K &nbsp;8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%&nbsp;

And: K-N-O-W-L-E- D-G-E 11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+ 5 = 96%&nbsp;

But: A-T-T-I-T-U- D-E 1+20+20+9+20+ 21+4+5 = 100%&nbsp;

Attitude Matters!!!&nbsp;
