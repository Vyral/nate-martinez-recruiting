Only a small percentage of agents make the most sales. Our team is part of that small percentage.

Did you know that 14,904 homes sold yesterday alone? That’s straight from the National Association of Realtors.

In the Phoenix area, there are about 88,000 home sales per year. That breaks down to 7,400 each month and 275 each day. With over 35,000 Realtors in the Valley of the Sun, **there are at least 26,000 Realtors who didn’t even sell a home last month.**

How does this happen? As you may or may not know, a lot of licensed agents around here only work in real estate part-time. At Re/MAX Professionals, we focus on real estate as a full-time career. **This is one of the reasons why our agents are able to sell 24 homes per year on average, the highest average in the Valley.**
