Are you a real estate agent who wants to build wealth? I want to let you know that you’re invited to our next training session, where you’ll learn how to do exactly that. You’ll learn how to embrace the habits and mindsets of the wealthy.

**You’ll also learn the seven pillars of wealth-building from none other than the guy who wrote the book—literally.** We’re flying in "Wealth Can’t Wait" author David Osborn. We’re going to give away all of our strategies and systems so you can build a profitable business.

When the event is over, you’ll leave with not only the knowledge to build wealth, but also a copy of David’s book.

However, space is limited so only the first 200 in attendance will receive this free copy. <a href="http://www.joinrmxprofessionals.com/Registration" target="_blank">To RSVP for this free event, click here.</a>

But there is one catch after you register: you have to show up.

**We hope to see you there on Thursday, November 2nd starting at 8:30 a.m.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
