As you may remember, I did a video a couple of months ago on the book “Wealth Can’t Wait” by David Osborn and Paul Morris.

Around that same time,&nbsp;**I had the pleasure of flying David in to give an hour-long talk on his book and how to build wealth.** The information he shared was truly valuable and is sure to help you build wealth in your life.

The next time you have an hour of free time, I’d like you to sit down and watch David’s presentation. [**You can find the video from that seminar here.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjvbStIUzx0&amp;feature=youtu.be){: target="_blank"}

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
