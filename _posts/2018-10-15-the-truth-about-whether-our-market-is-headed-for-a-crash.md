<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Are we headed for a crash? Let’s discuss this crucial question.</em></p>

Recently, a lot of people have been asking us whether the market is going to crash.&nbsp;

**In our local Phoenix area, the economy and the new construction market are booming.** This is very similar to what we saw before the last market crash, but this doesn’t necessarily mean history will repeat itself.&nbsp;

During the last crash, a lot of investors were entering our market with the intention of riding out potential appreciation. Today, though, the prospect of appreciation isn’t the primary driving force behind most home purchases. **This fact alone highlights the stark contrast between our market now and what we saw years ago.**&nbsp;

The bottom line is this: We may experience a correction within the next year or two, but today’s market conditions are a far cry from what was the case during the last crash.&nbsp;
