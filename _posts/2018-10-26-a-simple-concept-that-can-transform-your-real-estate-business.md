<p style="text-align: center;"><em>What if I told you that you could increase your business just by remembering “3, 2, 1?” Here’s what I mean.</em></p>

I’ve got a great tip for all of you agents out there today. **It’s a simple way to communicate with 1,250 people over the next 12 months.&nbsp;**

If you were to talk with 1,250 people in the next year, do you think your business would be better than it is now? It definitely would. **Here’s how the “3, 2, 1” method works.**

First, focus on **calling three past clients** or other people from your SOI every day and have a conversation with them. If you do this each day, Monday through Friday, that would equal 750 contacts over the course of the year.&nbsp;

Next, focus on **prospecting each day until you find two possible leads** you can add to your SOI. That’s another 500 contacts over the course of the year.

If you were able to close just 1% of those contacts, that’s an additional 12.5 transactions per year.&nbsp;

Finally, you need to **take some time out of each week to learn one new thing.** Whether it’s a lesson from a webinar, a book, or a conference, learning something new every week will give you 52 new pieces of knowledge each year. If you can work in one referral per day to someone in your SOI, that is a huge bonus.

I hope you use this method to increase your business and have more success in the coming year. If you have any questions about the “3, 2, 1” method or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
