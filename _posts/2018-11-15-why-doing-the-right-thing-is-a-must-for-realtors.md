Are you following your ethical responsibility as a Realtor to do the right thing? Today, we’ll discuss why this is important and what it entails.

Over the past few months, ethical concerns have been top-of-mind for Phoenix buyers, sellers, and homeowners. As a Realtor, myself, **I have noticed the rise of a few problematic trends within the industry.&nbsp;**

First, there’s the matter of how showings are conducted. There is a set of instructions real estate professionals are supposed to follow when showing properties. Lately, many Realtors are ignoring these guidelines. This must change. Following the showing instructions will improve the process for everyone involved. Ignoring these guidelines, meanwhile, can engender feelings of ill will. Remember: You aren’t the only person who your actions affect.&nbsp;

If you were to cancel a showing or show up late without giving the seller notice, for example, imagine how disheartening this might be for them. **Treating everyone’s time as being as valuable as your own is simply the right thing to do.**&nbsp;

In addition to this problem, there’s also the issue of showing agents not providing sellers with feedback. Oftentimes, the seller of a property will ask that showing agents tell them what they thought by filling out a short questionnaire. This questionnaire is usually sent via email, and it’s generally very easy to complete. Taking the few moments required to provide this feedback is the least we as Realtors can do.

Also, make sure this feedback isn’t too generic. Saying that the “buyer didn’t like the house” with no additional reason or context isn’t good feedback at all.&nbsp;

**When making decisions as an agent, put yourself in the seller’s shoes.** As professionals, we must never disregard their time, needs, and feelings. Each choice you make will shape the way our industry is viewed as a whole.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
