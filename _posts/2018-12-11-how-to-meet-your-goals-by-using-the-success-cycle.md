<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Following the success cycle can help you accomplish the big goals you’ve set for 2019.</em></p>

I recently attended a Tony Robbins event, and one of the powerful topics he covered was the **success cycle.** To help you find more success in your own real estate endeavors, I’ll be sharing Tony’s success cycle with you today.

**The success cycle is made up of four parts: potential, action, results, and belief/certainty.**

Each one of us has the **potential** to do anything we set our mind to. Let’s use an example goal of completing 100 transactions in 2019. Our **actions** will determine how we close these transactions.&nbsp;

As we do this, we need to track our **results.** For example, we need to know what our conversion ratio is when we meet with a seller. If you go on 10 listing appointments and gain a client through five, you have a 50% conversion ratio. Once you have this ratio, you can figure out how many listing appointments you’ll need to go on to achieve your goal of 100 transactions in 2019.

You may have taken action, but if you don’t have the **belief or certainty** in what you’re trying to achieve, it will be difficult to get things done.&nbsp;

I’d like to share a story with you about belief and certainty. Many years ago, I went to a CRS conference where some attendees wore a color-coded dot on their badge. **This dot meant they had done 100 transactions that year**, and most people wearing these dots were speaking about their success on stage. I had never heard of anybody doing 100 transactions in a year, but once I learned how it could be done, I was certain I could do it. **At this same conference the next year, I was able to wear the coveted dot on my badge.**
