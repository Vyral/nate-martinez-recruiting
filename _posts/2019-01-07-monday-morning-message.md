![](/uploads/Nates Monday Morning Message 2018.png)Welcome to the first Monday Morning Message on 2019! Let’s talk about resolutions and what is important for the New Year. Have you taken time to really think about what it is that you truly desire? How did you get to where you are today? The vast majority of people wake-up every day and go through the motions of what they have to do, and not necessarily what they want to do.

I would like to challenge you this year to live a more purposeful life; to be conscious of all the decisions you make (or don’t make). The only difference between you and the those who are living life on purpose is how you decide to spend your time. Let us resolve for 2019, to put the things that matter most, first. Let us resolve today that we will not let another week, or another year, go by without us taking full control and responsibility for all of our actions. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Beginning Today (Author Unknown)

Beginning today I will no longer worry about yesterday.<br>It is in the past and the past will never change.<br>Only I can change by choosing to do so.

Beginning today I will no longer worry about tomorrow.<br>Tomorrow will always be there, waiting for me to make the most of it.<br>But I cannot make the most of tomorrow without first<br>making the most of today.

Beginning today I will look in the mirror and I will see a person worthy&nbsp;<br>of my respect and admiration.&nbsp;<br>This capable person looking back at me is someone I enjoy spending time<br>with and someone I would like to get to know better.

Beginning today I will cherish each moment of my life.<br>I value this gift bestowed upon me in this world and I will unselfishly<br>share this gift with others.&nbsp;<br>I will use this gift to enhance the lives of others.

Beginning today I will take a moment to step off the beaten path and to<br>revel in the mysteries I encounter.<br>I will face challenges with courage and determination.<br>I will overcome what barriers there may be which hinder my quest for&nbsp;<br>growth and self-improvement.

Beginning today I will take life one day at a time, one step at a time.<br>Discouragement will not be allowed to taint my positive self-image,<br>my desire to succeed or my capacity to love.

Beginning today I walk with renewed faith in human kindness.<br>Regardless of what has gone before, I believe there is hope<br>for a brighter and better future.

Beginning today I will open my mind and my heart.<br>I will welcome new experiences. I will meet new people.<br>I will not expect perfection from myself nor anyone else: perfection does not exist in an imperfect world.<br>But I will applaud the attempt to overcome human foibles.

Beginning today I am responsible for my own happiness and I will do&nbsp;<br>things that make me happy . . .<br>admire the beautiful wonders of nature, listen to my favorite music,<br>pet a kitten or a puppy, soak in a bubble bath . . .<br>pleasure can be found in the most simple of gestures.

Beginning today I will learn something new; I will try something&nbsp;<br>different; I will savor all the various flavors life has to offer.<br>I will change what I can and the rest I will let go.<br>I will strive to become the best me I can possibly be.

Beginning today. And every day.
