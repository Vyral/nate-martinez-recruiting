Nate’s Monday Morning Message

Welcome to this edition of Nate's Monday Message! The weather has been a little unusual for the Valley of the Sun this winter, and this week brings us more rain and cooler temps. There is one thing for certain though, and that is seasons always change and the sun will always rise - in our lives and our businesses.

Are you prepared to make the most out of this week? Are you organized; determined; motivated; and just all around ready to succeed? Take a few minutes today to sit quietly and gather your thoughts. What are the five things you must do this week to be a success? What are the five things you must not do this week to be a success? Write them down and keep them with you. We must be prepared to succeed. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Everything Happens for The Good  

There was once a King who had a wise adviser. The adviser followed the King everywhere, and his favorite advice was, "everything happens for the good." One day the King went hunting and had a little accident. He shot an arrow at his own foot and was injured. He asked the adviser what he thought about the accident, to which the adviser replied, "Everything happens for the good." This time the King was really upset and ordered for his adviser to be put in prison. The King asked his adviser, "Now, what do you think?" The adviser again replied, "Everything happens for the good." So, the adviser remained in prison. 

The King later went on a hunting trip, this time without the adviser. The King was then captured by some cannibals. He was taken to the cannibals' camp where he was to be the evening meal for the cannibals. Before putting him into the cooking pot he was thoroughly inspected. The cannibals saw the wound on the King's foot and decided to throw him back into the jungle. According to the cannibals' tradition, they would not eat anything that was imperfect. As a result, the King was spared. The King suddenly realized what his adviser said was true. The adviser also escaped death because had he not been in prison, he would have followed the King on the hunting trip and would have ended up in the cooking pot.
