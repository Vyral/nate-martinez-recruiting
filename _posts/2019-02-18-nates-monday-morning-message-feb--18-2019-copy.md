Welcome to this edition of Nate's Monday Message…Happy President’s Day! There are many things in life that we have control over, and many things that we do not. But most importantly, we have choices and we get to choose to start each day with the proper mindset. We get to choose our own actions, and what we will do or not do today. You can’t control others, but you can choose how you interact with them. You can’t control the outcome, but you can choose how you react to it. This week, make it a point to focus on your choices, and you will find that you have more control that you realize. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow - Author Unknown

There are two days in every week about which we should not worry.&nbsp;<br>Two days which should be kept free from fear and apprehension.<br>One of these days is yesterday with its mistakes and cares,<br>Its faults and blunders, Its aches and pains.<br>Yesterday has passed forever beyond our control.<br>All the money in the world cannot bring back yesterday.<br>We cannot undo a single act we performed.<br>We cannot erase a single word we said. Yesterday is gone.<br>The other day we should not worry about is tomorrow.<br>With its possible adversities, its burdens,&nbsp;<br>Its large promise and poor performance.<br>Tomorrow is also beyond our immediate control.<br>Tomorrow's Sun will rise, either in splendor or behind a mask of clouds, but it will rise.<br>Until it does, we have no stake in tomorrow, for it is yet unborn.<br>This just leaves only one day . . . Today.<br>Any person can fight the battles of just one day.<br>It is only when you and I add the burdens of those two awful eternity's - yesterday and tomorrow that we break down.<br>It is not the experience of today that drives people mad.<br>It is the remorse or bitterness for something which happened yesterday and the dread of what tomorrow may bring.<br>Let us therefore live but one day at a time.
