**Nate’s Monday Morning Message**

Welcome to this edition of Nate's Monday Message! Are you prepared for the success that you are about to have? This is one of the biggest things that holds people back from success: the fear of success itself. But did you know that fear has the same physical emotion in the body as extreme excitement? It is all in how we label what we feel. Fear merely stands for: false evidence appearing real. Be prepared for the success you have working towards, and it is more likely to happen. Put yourself in a position to succeed in all aspects of your life daily. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Just BE THANKFUL 

Be thankful that you don't already have everything you desire. If you did, what would there be to look forward to? Be thankful when you don't know something, for it gives you the opportunity to learn new things. Be thankful for the difficult times. Those are the times you grow. Be thankful for your limitations, because they give you opportunities for improvement. Be thankful for your mistakes. They will teach you valuable lessons for the future. 

Be thankful when you are tired and weary, because it means you've made a difference. It’s easy to be thankful for the good things. A life of rich fulfillment comes to those who are also thankful for the setbacks and bumpy times. Find a way to be thankful for your troubles, and they can become your blessings. 

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do.”- Pele

“If you want to conquer fear, don't sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.” - Dale Carnegie

“Without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning.” - Benjamin Franklin

“The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” - Franklin D. Roosevelt
