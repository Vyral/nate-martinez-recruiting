**Nate’s Monday Morning Message**

![](/uploads/181219-natemondaymessage-v1-6.png)

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate's Monday Message! I trust that each of you reading this had a wonderful weekend, filled with enjoyment and memories made. Today, I want to talk to you about fairness and understanding. Many of us heard as children that "life just is not fair." I am not sure that I agree, because you see life is what you make of it, and fairness is subjective. We all know people who are deliberate, thoughtful, and fair. We also know people who are non-deliberate, non-thoughtful and not very fair.

I would encourage you to take a look at yourself and ask if you are deliberate, thoughtful, and fair. Regardless of what life has done for you up until today, the future is a clean canvas and you are the painter. Make wise choices and be fair and understanding. Life will bring back to you what you give to others. Let’s make it a great week!

“I think perfect objectivity is an unrealistic goal; fairness, however, is not.” - Michael Pollan
