Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate's Monday Message! Today I want to write about persistence. The challenge of doing anything meaningful in life, is being able to do what is necessary over and over and not giving up, even with it gets hard. This is the part that we must focus on daily. A plan without action is worthless. We need enough persistence to continuously work the plan day-in and day-out. Persistence will get us to where we want to be…and what need to achieve a big dream. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Growing Good Corn, Author Unknown

There once was a farmer who grew award-winning corn. Each year he entered his corn in the state fair where it won a blue ribbon.

One year a newspaper reporter interviewed him and learned something interesting about how he grew it. The reporter discovered that the farmer shared his seed corn with his neighbors.

"How can you afford to share your best seed corn with your neighbors when they are entering corn in competition with yours each year?" the reporter asked.

"Why sir," said the farmer," didn't you know? The wind picks up pollen from the ripening corn and swirls it from field to field. If my neighbors grow inferior corn, cross-pollination will steadily degrade the quality of my corn. If I am to grow good corn, I must help my neighbors grow good corn."

He is very much aware of the connectedness of life. His corn cannot improve unless his neighbor's corn also improves.

So it is with our lives. Those who choose to live in peace must help their neighbors to live in peace. Those who choose to live well must help others to live well, for the value of a life is measured by the lives it touches. And those who choose to be happy must help others to find happiness, for the welfare of each is bound up with the welfare of all.

The lesson for each of us is this: if we are to grow good corn, we must help our neighbors grow good corn.&nbsp;
