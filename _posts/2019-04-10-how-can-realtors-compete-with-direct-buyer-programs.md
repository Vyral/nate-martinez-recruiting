*Should Realtors be concerned about new technology in real estate? Our panel of experts weighed in on this topic recently.*

There's recently been a lot of hype surrounding new technology in real estate. Whether it’s from OpenDoor, Zillow, or any other number of companies, there is no shortage of online homebuyers who are looking to make instant offers on homes for sale. As Realtors, should we be worried about this new level of competition?

We recently discussed this issue with a panel of experts from RE/MAX Professionals on how they navigate the market now that these direct buyer programs have entered the fray.

Some of the topics we discussed include:

* Strategies for representing both sellers and buyers through iBuyer programs
* Scripting techniques and negotiating commissions when working with direct buyers
* Convey your value as an agent compared to a technology company
* Setting expectations for service fees and repairs on a listing
* How to when a client has received a previous offer from a direct buyer

Watch this short video to view a few highlights from this panel discussion so you can stay ahead of the curve when dealing with new trends in real estate technology.
