**Nate’s Monday Morning Message**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate's Monday Message\! I hope everyone enjoyed the Easter holiday weekend\! Let's start out this week taking a few minutes to examine where we are in both our personal and business lives.&nbsp;

Do we have a stated purpose for both? Do we have a plan to achieve the result desired? Are we working each and every day on the actions that our plan calls for? Are we happy? Do we need to make some changes or work a little harder or smarter to achieve our goals? Are we allowing negative people or thoughts to influence us?

We decide what we will or will not do. We have control over what thoughts will or will not influence us. We choose to act the way we do every minute of every day. If we choose to, we have the power to change anything in our lives for the better. I would love to hear from you on what you plan to do this week to get you closer to your purpose in life\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

“Storms Bring Out the Eagles, But the Little Birds Take Cover.” - Helen Steiner Rice

When the "storms of life"

Gather darkly ahead,

I think of these wonderful words&nbsp;

I once read.

And I say to myself&nbsp;

As "threatening clouds" hover,

Don't "fold up your wings"

And "run for cover."

But like the eagle,

"Spread wide your wings"

And "soar far above"

The troubles life brings.

For the eagle knows

That the higher he flies,

The more tranquil and brighter&nbsp;

Become the skies.&nbsp;

And there is nothing in life

God ever asks us to bear&nbsp;

That we can't soar above&nbsp;

"On the wings of prayer."

And in looking back over

The "storm you passed through,"

You'll find you gained strength&nbsp;

And new courage, too.

For in facing "life's storms"

With an eagle's wings,

You can fly far above&nbsp;

Earth's small, petty things.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Learn to get in touch with the silence within yourself, and know that everything in life has purpose. There are no mistakes, no coincidences, all events are blessings given to us to learn from.” - Elisabeth Kubler-Ross

“What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.” - Zig Ziglar

“Successful people maintain a positive focus in life no matter what is going on around them. They stay focused on their past successes rather than their past failures, and on the next action steps they need to take to get them closer to the fulfillment of their goals rather than all the other distractions that life presents to them.” - Jack Canfield
