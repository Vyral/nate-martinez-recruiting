## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate's Monday Message\! I want to take this opportunity to wish each of you reading this who are mother’s - including those who are step-moms and grandmother’s doing double duty - a very happy Mother’s Day celebration this coming weekend.

I also want to give a big shout out to my daughter Brandi for being an amazing mother to my granddaughter, Hayden. It is a joy I can’t describe to see my child raising her own child with such grace, confidence, love and compassion. To my partner Tonya, who is the mother of my youngest daughter Mila, I want to thank you for your constant dedication to our family, to our home and the efforts you put into raising our daughter to be a bright, loving, ambition young lady. I could not do it without you.

Lastly to my own Mother, I want to say thank you for helping me to become the man I am today. I know it was not an easy journey raising me and my siblings by yourself and I want you to know that there isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t thank you for your dedication, love and strength.

I hope that you will each take a moment this week and over the weekend to thank your own mom on this Mother’s Day celebration. Let’s make it a great week\!
