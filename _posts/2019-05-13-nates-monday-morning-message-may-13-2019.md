## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate's Monday Message\! I hope everyone had a wonderful Mother’s Day celebration\! As we prepare ourselves for another amazing week, let us keep in mind that what we choose to do with our time is completely up to us. We can choose to be in a great mood, or we can choose not to. We can choose to focus on the things in our lives we have control over, or we can choose not to. We can choose to work harder, smarter, and more creatively than our competition or we can choose not to. What do you have control over and what will you do about it? The wonderful thing about life is that it is all up to us. Focus on actions and the results will follow. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

We shall do much in the years to come,<br>But what have we done today?

We shall give out gold in a princely sum,<br>But what did we give today?

We shall lift the heart and dry the tear,<br>We shall plant a hope in the place of fear,

We shall speak the words of love and cheer,<br>But what did we speak today ?

We shall be so kind in the after while,<br>But what have we done today?

We shall bring to each lonely life a smile,<br>But what have we brought today?

We shall give to truth a grander birth,<br>And to steadfast faith a deeper worth,

We shall feed the hungering souls of earth,<br>But whom have we fed today?

We shall reap such joys in the by and by,<br>But what have we sown today?

We shall build us mansions in the sky,<br>But what have we built today?&nbsp;

\`Tis sweet in the idle dreams to bask;<br>But here and now, do we our task?

Yet, this is the thing our souls must ask,<br>What have we done today?

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Don't wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it's at work or with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed and savored.” - Earl Nightingale

“Look at the sky. We are not alone. The whole universe is friendly to us and conspires only to give the best to those who dream and work.” - A. P. J. Abdul Kalam

“Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come.” - Dwayne Johnson
