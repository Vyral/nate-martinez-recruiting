## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate's Monday Message…its hard to believe it is already June, which means that school is out, vacations are on the horizon and of course, the temperatures will soar into the triple digits\! Amid the summertime fun, we must not lose sight of our goals and ambitions in life. So this week, I’d like to talk about persistence. We need to focus on a plan and putting action steps in place so we can remain on track over the next few months.

The challenge of doing anything worthwhile is being able to do what is necessary over and over and not giving up – which is persistence. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Growing Good Corn, Author Unknown&nbsp;

There once was a farmer who grew award-winning corn. Each year he entered his corn in the state fair where it won a blue ribbon. &nbsp;

One year a newspaper reporter interviewed him and learned something interesting about how he grew it. The reporter discovered that the farmer shared his seed corn with his neighbors.

"How can you afford to share your best seed corn with your neighbors when they are entering corn in competition with yours each year?" the reporter asked.

"Why sir," said the farmer, "didn't you know? The wind picks up pollen from the ripening corn and swirls it from field to field. If my neighbors grow inferior corn, cross-pollination will steadily degrade the quality of my corn. If I am to grow good corn, I must help my neighbors grow good corn."

He is very much aware of the connectedness of life. His corn cannot improve unless his neighbor's corn also improves.

So it is with our lives. Those who choose to live in peace must help their neighbors to live in peace. Those who choose to live well must help others to live well, for the value of a life is measured by the lives it touches. And those who choose to be happy must help others to find happiness, for the welfare of each is bound up with the welfare of all.

The lesson for each of us is this: if we are to grow good corn, we must help our neighbors grow good corn. It is possible to give away and become richer\! It is also possible to hold on too tightly and lose everything. Yes, the liberal man shall be rich\! By watering others, he waters himself.
