## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate's Monday Message\! Over the weekend, as I spent time with my family it got me thinking about how we spend our time whether it is at work or at play or simple hanging out at home. Are we really making the best use of our time each and every day? Are there times when if we planned a little better, we could get more done? Do we wish we had more time to spend on the things we truly love? There is a solution to maximizing our time.

Set a goal, create a plan, and then accomplish it. This will be our challenge for this week. If you found 30 minutes a day, what would you do with it? Think long and hard about this answer as this will be what you think about while figuring out what you can change around, do differently, or eliminate from your schedule. Time is the one thing that is equal among all of us. How we use it is what makes all the difference in the world. Use it wisely for once it is gone it can never be replaced. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

**Take Time**

Take time to laugh<br>It is the music of the soul.

Take time to thinkI<br>t is the source of power.

Take time to play<br>It is the source of perpetual youth.

Take time to read<br>It is the fountain of wisdom.

Take time to pray<br>It is the greatest power on earth.

Take time to love and be loved<br>It is a God-given privilege.

Take time to be friendly<br>It is the road to happiness

Take time to give<br>It is too short a day to be selfish

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Successful people maintain a positive focus in life no matter what is going on around them. They stay focused on their past successes rather than their past failures, and on the next action steps they need to take to get them closer to the fulfillment of their goals rather than all the other distractions that life presents to them.” - Jack Canfield

“In every day, there are 1,440 minutes. That means we have 1,440 daily opportunities to make a positive impact.” - Les Brown

“Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow.” - Helen Keller
