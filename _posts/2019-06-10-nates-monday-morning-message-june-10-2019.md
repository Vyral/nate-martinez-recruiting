## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message**

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message\! Over time we accumulate things that are a result of our hard work and determination. However, let us keep in mind that the tangible possessions around us are not the reason for living, but rather the result of a life lived properly. The people and the experiences we have are so much more valuable than any item we may acquire.

Let this week’s message be a reminder to be present in all that you do. Slow down and concentrate on the conversations you are having with your children, spouse, or other loved ones. Slow down and enjoy the thoughts that you may have about experiences of the past. Slow down and think about all the great people and opportunities that are surrounding you each day. Commit to living a life you truly enjoy…and let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

The Coffee

A group of alumni, highly established in their careers, got together to visit their old university professor. Conversation soon turned into complaints about stress in work and life. Offering his guests coffee, the professor went to the kitchen and returned with a large pot of coffee and an assortment of cups - porcelain, plastic, glass, crystal, some plain looking, some expensive, some exquisite - telling them to help themselves to the coffee.

When all the students had a cup of coffee in hand, the professor said: "If you noticed, all the nice looking expensive cups were taken up, leaving behind the plain and cheap ones. While it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves, that is the source of your problems and stress. Be assured that the cup itself adds no quality to the coffee in most cases, it’s just more expensive and in some cases even hides what we drink.

What all of you really wanted was coffee, not the cup, but you consciously went for the best cups... and then began eyeing each other’s cups.

Now consider this: Life is the coffee, and the jobs, money and position in society are the cups. They are just tools to hold and contain Life, and the type of cup we have does not define, nor change the quality of Life we live. Sometimes, by concentrating only on the cup, we fail to enjoy the coffee."

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.” - Maya Angelou

“Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me.” - Carol Burnett

“Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Don't wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it's at work or with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed and savored.” - Earl Nightingale
