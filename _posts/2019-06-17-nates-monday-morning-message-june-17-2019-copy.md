## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message**

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message\! This morning, I wanted to remind all of you of the 5 P's of Life: Prior - Planning - Prevents - Poor - Performance. To be truly successful in all we do both personally and professionally, planning is a must\! We must plan for what we need to do and also plan for the different roadblocks that may and most likely will get in our way.

When these roadblocks pop-up we will be prepared and able to act quickly. Once we have our plans, we can go after our goals with the passion, determination, and focus to be successful. Spending a small amount of time in the beginning can save you a bunch of time in the end. Remember that you must also take action\! Taking action is honestly the single biggest differentiator to success. Follow the 5 P's and take action EVERYDAY\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Principles of Life:

Winning isn't everything but wanting to win is.

You would achieve more, if you don't mind who gets the credit.

When everything else is lost, the future still remains.

Don't fight too much or the enemy will know your art of war.

The only job you start at the top is when you dig a grave.

If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for everything.

If you do little things well, you'll do big ones better.

Only thing that comes to you without effort is old age.

You won't get a second chance to make a first impression.

Only those who do nothing do not make mistakes.If you are not failing, you're not taking enough risks.

Don't try to get rid of your bad temper by losing it.

If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you.

Those who don't make mistakes usually don't make anything.

There are two kinds of failures: Those who think and never do, and those who do and never think.

Pick battles big enough to matter, small enough to win.

All progress has resulted from unpopular decisions.

Change your thoughts and you change your world.

Understanding proves intelligence, not the speed of the learning.

There are two kinds of fools in this world: Those who give advice and those who don't take it.

Management is doing things right.

Leadership is doing the right things.

Friendship founded on business is always better than business founded on friendship.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“When it is obvious that the goals cannot be reached, don't adjust the goals, adjust the action steps.” – Confucius

“Successful people maintain a positive focus in life no matter what is going on around them. They stay focused on their past successes rather than their past failures, and on the next action steps they need to take to get them closer to the fulfillment of their goals rather than all the other distractions that life presents to them.” - Jack Canfield

“Vision without action is merely a dream. Action without vision just passes the time. Vision with action can change the world.” - Joel A. Barker
