<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Telling the right stories can help you secure more clients, and today I’ll explain how.</em></p>

I recently read an article that explained how **sellers lost $14 billion in equity last year because of the increasing number of iBuyers entering our market.** Selling to these companies is usually advertised as a convenient deal, but is actually a very ineffective move for today’s sellers.&nbsp;

So, what can you do to dissuade sellers from going that route? One of the simplest ways is by doing what you do best: Offering expert real estate advice.

**Given that 71% of buyers are afraid to buy a home that needs work, some of the best advice you can offer sellers is to make strategic repairs.** The right repairs and upgrades will not only bring a high return, but they’ll also help sellers to close quickly and for top dollar.&nbsp;

Once you’ve guided a seller to closing using this (or any other tips), you can use the success stories that come out of these experiences to help you secure future clients who might have otherwise considered selling to an iBuyer.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
