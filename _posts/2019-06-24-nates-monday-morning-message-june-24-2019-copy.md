## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message**

Welcome to another edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message\! As we are constantly working on improving ourselves and our situations, we try to make things better each day, in big and small ways. The challenge becomes the consistency of doing it.

Like many things in life they get harder to do over time and we need to dig deeper and deeper to find the strength and determination to succeed. What it comes down to is passion. Do you have the passion to achieve the goal that you are working towards? Do you have the passion to put up with the bad with the hope that the good will be so very worth it? You must find your passion in everything you do. It is a mindset and it can be created over and over and over if you desire the end result bad enough. Passion is the gas that runs your engine. Find yours and put it to work\! Let’s make it a great week\!
