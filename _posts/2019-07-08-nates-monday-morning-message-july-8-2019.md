I hope that you will take some time during the evenings this summer to enjoy the awe-inspiring clouds and vivid colors that fill our sky; it truly is magnificent and a perfect reminder of the simple blessings that surround us every day.

Don’t take for granted the simple beauties in life, as they pave the way to finding a deeper meaning to happiness. Take time to appreciate all the good in your life and make each moment count\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

A Fish Stranded in a Drying Puddle

Once there was a fellow walking along a road. Suddenly he heard a faint cry. He looked around but saw nothing. Thinking he heard nothing, he continued to walk. Again he heard the faint cry. This time the call was nearby. He searched high and low, and found the sound was coming out of a little fish lying in a drying pond. His mouth gurgling. That person looked at the fish strangely and asked,"Was that you who was just calling me? Was it you needing my help?"The small fish looking pleading at the man gasping and breathless said, "Please save me quickly, I am dying, I need water. I am not a normal fish, rather I am the eastern sea dragon's official. Please give me a little water." That person hearing this hurriedly nodded his head and said, "I understand, I will immediately go to the south and let the southern king redirect a river to here so that you can swim and return to the eastern sea." The fish angrily cried out, "Can a fish live out of water? I am only in need of a little water. Your idea is pointless. I think that the next time you see me will be in a shop that sells dried fish. "The story tells us to reconsider solutions that we usually propose to solve real life problems. Sometimes we take our time too much to find the most ideal solution, while what the problem really needs is time critical solution.We must always aware that many times in our lives we don't need the best solution but some quick fixes for the current situation to prevent it of becoming worse. Only until then, we have much more time to think and find the ideal solution.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend.” - Melody Beattie

“To succeed in life, you need three things: a wishbone, a backbone and a funny bone.” - Reba McEntire

“Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it.” - Chuck Palahniuk
