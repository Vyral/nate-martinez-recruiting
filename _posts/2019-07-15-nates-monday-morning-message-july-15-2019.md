## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message**

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message\! We all face similar challenges in our lives, and we all handle those challenges differently. There a few things that we all could do better to make the challenges that will come a little easier to handle. First, keep in mind that there will always be challenges and disruptions that throw us off course; that is life and we all go through it. Second, your reaction to what happens to you is 100 percent within your control. You may not control what happens, but you control what you do about it. Third, pointing fingers or placing blame on others never solves the problem at hand. The goal is to understand what happened why and what you learned from it. Then move on. Fourth, love more and argue less. Spend your time loving rather than arguing with many. Fifth, realize your time here is limited and the clock is ticking. Don't waste time because once it’s gone, you can’t get it back. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

It's the Journey That's Important by John McLeod

Life, sometimes so wearying<br>Is worth its weight in gold<br>The experience of traveling<br>Lends a wisdom that is old

Beyond our 'living memory'<br>A softly spoken prayer:"<br>It's the journey that's important,<br>Not the getting there\!"

Ins and outs and ups and downs<br>Life's road meanders aimlessly?<br>Or so it seems, but somehow<br>Leads us where we need to be,

And being simply human<br>We oft question and compare...<br>"Is the journey so important<br>Or the getting there?"

And thus it's always been<br>That question pondered down the ages<br>By simple people with simple ways<br>To wise and ancient sages...

How sweet then, quietly knowing<br>Reaching destination fair:<br>"It's the journey that's important,<br>Not the getting there\!"&nbsp;

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars.” - Og Mandino

“If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.” - Henry David Thoreau

“I can't change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.” - Jimmy Dean
