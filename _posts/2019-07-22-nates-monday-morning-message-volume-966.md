## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 966**

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message\! Today I would like to focus on failure, or better yet the courage it takes to keep going in the face of adversity. We have all faced a difficult time or two in our lives, but what made us get back up and continue moving forward? What pushed us to keep trying? I want to remind you about a few important people in history who didn’t give up, even when the odds were stacked again them…

**Thomas Edison**\: was considered one of the most prolific inventors in history, was told as a boy he was too stupid to learn anything. He tried more than 9,000 experiments before he was successful in creating the first light bulb. There are now 1,093 U.S. patents in his name.

**Michael Jordon**\: was known today as one of the greatest basketball players of all times, was removed from his high school basketball team because of his “lack of skill.”

**Steven Spielberg**\: American film director who has won multiple Academy Awards and considered one of the most successful filmmakers ever, dropped out of junior high school. He later came back and was placed in a learning-disabled class. He dropped out of school for good just one month later.

These are just a few of the countless stories of highly successful people who have failed or who have been told they couldn’t do it, and yet surprised the world because they had a dream. Don’t give up on your dreams, whatever they are…don’t give up\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.” - Helen Keller

“Stand up to your obstacles and do something about them. You will find that they haven't half the strength you think they have.” – Norman Vincente Peale

“Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.” - Harriet Tubman

“Be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies.” - Mother Teresa
