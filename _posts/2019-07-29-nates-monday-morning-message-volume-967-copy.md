## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 967**

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message\! Every day we have an opportunity to work on ourselves and improve who we are. One of the most important things you can do is improve your skills or knowledge. What areas of your life need improvement?

If you need help, seek out the information or the people who can help you. The only things that make you different from one day to the next is the people you meet and the things you learn. Make learning and therefore growing a part of your daily life. Let’s make it a great week\!

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Do not wait; the time will never be 'just right.' Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along.” - George Herbert

“Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.” - Steve Jobs

“Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. The only people who never tumble are those who never mount the high wire. This is your moment. Own it.” - Oprah Winfrey
