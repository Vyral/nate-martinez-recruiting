## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 968**

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message\! The beginning of August marks the official start of our fundraising efforts for the Month of Miracles, to benefit our local Phoenix Children’s Hospital. And today I’d like to share a little bit about why we participate in this worthy cause.

Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals&reg; raises funds and awareness for 170 member hospitals that provide 32 million treatments each year to kids across the U.S. and Canada. Donations stay local to fund critical treatments and healthcare services, pediatric medical equipment and charitable care. Since 1983, Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals has raised more than $5 billion, most of it $1 at a time through the charity’s Miracle Balloon icon. Its various fundraising partners and programs support the nonprofit’s mission to save and improve the lives of as many children as possible.

Last year our Month of Miracles events surpassed our goal of one million pennies and raised more than $18,000 to benefit our local Phoenix Children’s Hospital – additionally throughout the year in 2018 our agents contributed $47,000 in donations\! We could not do it without our generous agents, our family, friends and of course our loyal clients who continue to trust us with their real estate needs. I hope we can depend on your support again this year. You can stop by any one of our three Valley office locations, or made a donation online: [https://rem.ax/2yvmXTo](https://rem.ax/2yvmXTo){: target="_blank"}

I want to thank you in advance for your donations\! Let’s make it a great week\!
