<p style="text-align: center;"><em>No matter if you’re a Realtor® or you offer some other service to buyers and sellers in the Valley, Nate’s List benefits all.</em></p>

Is your list of quality vendors to refer your clients to pretty short right now?&nbsp;

In light of the current construction boom in our Phoenix marketplace, I know mine is, and I’d like to add to my network. To achieve that, **my team and I are looking to build an amazing client service list—Nate’s List, as we call it.&nbsp;**

When it comes to mortgage lenders, title, and insurance, we have some deeply established relationships already, but our goal is to cast our net a little wider and foster relationships with all sorts of vendors who service buyers and sellers.&nbsp;

Since starting RE/MAX Professionals nineteen years ago, **we’ve served around 60,000 clients across the Valley—many of whom would like to enlist the help of a professional, highly reputable provider to fill their specific needs.**&nbsp;

Nate’s List will feature everything from landscapers to pool cleaners to clothing cleaners and more. If you provide a service that buyers and sellers can benefit from, **I’d like to be the conduit between you and our past clients.**

Here are just a few examples of questions we’ve recently received from clients: “Do you know someone who can put a snake fence up?” “Do you know someone who can do a plumbing repair?” “Do you know someone who can install an electrical plug for my electric car?” And the list goes on and on\!&nbsp;

In closing, if you’re a Realtor® and you’d like to build your own database full of amazing service providers, I’d be happy to sit down with you and discuss what we’re doing to make this happen. If you’re a vendor and you’d like to bring value to our clients, please fill out this form and let us know what sort of expertise you have to offer. No matter your area of specialty, I look forward to hearing from you soon\!&nbsp;
