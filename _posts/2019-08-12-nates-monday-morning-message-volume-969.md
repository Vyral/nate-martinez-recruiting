## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 969**

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message\! Today I would like to ask you what this statement means to you: “money doesn’t grow on trees.” What does that remind you of? How does it make you feel? For me, it is a reminder of how far I have come both personally and professionals, and how different life is for my three children. Growing up in Maryvale with a single mom who struggled to make ends meet, money didn’t grow on trees and she had to work hard for the money we did have. And I know many of you reading this can relate.

I decided at a young age that I would have a different relationship with money. I chose to let money work for me, not against me. If we believe that making money is a hard, then it will always be hard. True, money doesn’t grow on trees, however, our attitudes and beliefs towards money impact how easily and frequently it comes into our lives. Instead of telling yourself that “money doesn’t grow on trees,” change the dialogue to be more in alignment with the goals you have in life in which you need money to support. Two of my favorites are: “my necessities are met with abundance” and “I live in a world of abundance.” Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

The Taoist Farmer

This farmer had only one horse, and one day the horse ran away. The neighbors came to condole over his terrible loss. The farmer said, "What makes you think it is so terrible?"A month later, the horse came home, this time bringing with her two beautiful wild horses. The neighbors became excited at the farmer's good fortune. Such lovely strong horses\! The farmer said, "What makes you think this is good fortune?"The farmer's son was thrown from one of the wild horses and broke his leg. All the neighbors were very distressed. Such bad luck\! The farmer said, "What makes you think it is bad?"A war came, and every able-bodied man was conscripted and sent into battle. Only the farmer's son, because he had a broken leg, remained. The neighbors congratulated the farmer. "What makes you think this is good?" said the farmer.\*As told by Executive editor, Elise Hancock, in the&nbsp;[Johns Hopkins Magazine](http://www.jhu.edu/~jhumag/), November 1993, page 2, in section entitled Editor's Note.
