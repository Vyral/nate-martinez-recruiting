## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 970**

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message\! We are about halfway through the 2019 Month of Miracle to benefit our local Phoenix Children’s Hospital. I would like to extend a special invitation to each of you to join us on **Friday, August 23rd** for our [second annual live auction](https://www.facebook.com/events/362385607703406/) event.

Last year our Month of Miracles events surpassed our goal of one million pennies and raised more than $18,000 to benefit PCH – and the live auction event raised more than $6,400.00 in just two hours\! We have a generous list of items that will be available on Friday, ranging from a variety of gift backsets, foursome golf packages, Cardinal tickets and two tickets to see Cher in her upcoming tour\! This event starts on [Friday, August 23rd at 5:30pm](https://www.facebook.com/events/362385607703406/) and we will be hosting it again this year at [Salt Tacos y Tequila](https://www.facebook.com/SaltWestgate/?eid=ARDqJ8tFEvR-XZE26dkZ-t4e_gzN_pH-84RMn9UBAvtwQgUzcWy3NHKSE3sw6-oe6bOuZLVvxIPDvoz-) at Westgate.

Please feel free to share this invite with your family, friends and favorite businesses (we are still accepting donations for the live auction and would love your support if you own a business or have a favorite\!). We hope to see you there\! Let’s make it a great week\!

P.S. If you are not able to attend the live auction, you can still support our fundraising efforts by making a donation online: [https://rem.ax/2yvmXTo](https://rem.ax/2yvmXTo){: target="_blank"}
