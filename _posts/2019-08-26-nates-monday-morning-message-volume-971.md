## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 970**

“Every time a football player goes to ply his trade, he’s got to play from the ground up – from the soles of his feet right up to his head. Every inch of him has to play. Some guys play with their heads. That is okay. You’ve got to be smart to be number one in any business. But more importantly, you’ve got to play with your heart, with every fiber of your body. If you’re lucky enough to find a guy with a lot of head and a lot of heart, he’s never going to come off the field second.” Vince Lombardi

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message\! With football season right around the corner, I thought I would share one of my favorite quotes from the great Vince Lombardi. Each of you have goals, dreams and aspirations but in order to truly live a life we love, it takes guts, it takes sweat, it takes heart and sometimes it takes tears. It takes knowing what you want with every fiber of your body and going for it with passion and tenacity. It takes never giving up no matter the obstacles you face. I challenge you this week to take the leap you have been waiting for…face the fears…wipe away the tears and dig down deep. Do what it takes to make your life one that makes your want to jump out of bed each morning because you get to be YOU\! Let’s make it a great week\!

P.S. This is the last week of this year’s Month of Miracles\! Please help us reach our goal of One Million Pennies to benefit our local Phoenix Children’s Hospital. You can make a donation online at: [https://rem.ax/2yvmXTo](https://rem.ax/2yvmXTo){: target="_blank"}

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Everyone Has a Story in Life

A 24-year-old boy seeing out from the train’s window shouted, “Dad, look the trees are going behind\!”

Dad smiled and a young couple sitting nearby, looked at the 24-year old’s childish behavior with pity, suddenly he again exclaimed, “Dad, look the clouds are running with us\!”

The couple couldn’t resist and said to the old man…“Why don’t you take your son to a good doctor?”

The old man smiled and said, “I did, and we are just coming from the hospital, my son was blind from birth, he just got his eyes today.”

Every single person on the planet has a story. Don’t judge people before you truly know them. The truth might surprise you.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.” - Zig Ziglar

“I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.” – Nelson Mandela

“I am rare, and there is value in all rarity; therefore, I am valuable.” – Og Mandino
