Today I want to give you a few tips about how to maintain and track successful habits in your business.

Here in the office, my team uses something called the Daily Success Habits Tracker, and I want to take some time today to tell you about how it can help you.

Over my career in real estate, I’ve found that agents either have good habits or bad habits. Obviously, the goal is to take those bad habits and transform them into good habits.

**With the Daily Success Habits Tracker, we are able to focus on making sure each day is productive.** Here’s how it works:

Essentially, **the tracker is a kind of chart that we’ve attached a point-system to.** The left column tracks the time throughout the day in half-hour increments. The center column lists the “61 Points of Rhythm,” which are 61 daily activities that are necessary to maintaining business; each activity is given a certain number of points, which you earn if you complete the tasks. Each tasks, such as prospecting via phone calls, can be completed more than once to earn multiple points.

The column on the right allows you to track your prospecting times for the various sessions you do throughout the day. At the top of the tracker, there is a dial tracker to allow you to see how many calls you made during your day.

**To see a visual representation of the tracker and to hear various examples in which agents can earn points, refer to 0:42 in the video above.**

Overall, this tracker is a good way to hold yourself accountable to productive activities, to help you look back on your day to see what you did right and wrong, and to help you improve your overall business production.

If you have any questions about the Daily Success Habits Tracker or would like a copy it for your own purposes, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.
