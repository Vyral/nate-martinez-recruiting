## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 973: Remembering 9/11**

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message\! Today I want to remember the 2,753 people who perished in the World Trade Center attacks that occurred on 9/11/2001. That day is a day that will be forever remembered in our hearts and in our country. For me, my family and my team, it will always be the day that we took a giant leap of faith, in the midst of confusion, chaos and heartbreak and forged forward with the first day that RE/MAX Professionals opened its doors.

We are proud of the company we have become today and so, so grateful that we live in a country which affords us the opportunities we have. I hope this week you will take a moment to remember those brave men and women who were the first responders on 9/11, as well as the many lives who were lost and the families who were impacted. We live in a great nation and 9/11 is a day that should never be forgotten or taken for granted\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

We’re Still Standing by Hannah Schoechert, 7th grade student

Those twin towers<br>Standing tall with pride,<br>Fell with grieving hearts.<br>Stunned, America cried.

But we’re still standing.

Bin Laden tried<br>To crush our land,<br>But we stood our ground<br>With our flag in hand.

And we’re still standing.

Red for valor<br>And the blood that fell.<br>White for purity<br>Our heroes tell.

Blue for the justice<br>That will be done,<br>Proving once more<br>These colors don’t run.

And we’re still standing.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“America was not built on fear. America was built on courage, on imagination and an unbeatable determination to do the job at hand.” - Harry S Truman

“We, the People, recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights; that our destinies are bound together; that a freedom which only asks what's in it for me, a freedom without a commitment to others, a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism, is unworthy of our founding ideals, and those who died in their defense.” - Barack Obama

“I believe our flag is more than just cloth and ink. It is a universally recognized symbol that stands for liberty, and freedom. It is the history of our nation, and it's marked by the blood of those who died defending it.” - John Thune
