## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 974: the Month of Miracles Grand Total**

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message\! Last week in our monthly business meeting we announced the grand total of fundraising that our offices generated during the month of August, and today I’d like to share that success with you\!

Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals&reg; raises funds and awareness for 170 member hospitals that provide 32 million treatments each year to kids across the U.S. and Canada. Donations stay local with our Phoenix Children’s Hospital and go to fund critical treatments and healthcare services, pediatric medical equipment and charitable care. Since 1983, Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals has raised more than $5 billion\!

Which brings me to our totals for this year…collectively our agents and offices were able to raise **$21,263.10** which is more than **double the goal** we set for the Month of Miracles. For the past eighteen years we have continued to fundraise for our local PCH and because of the support we receive from our generous agent and loyal clients we have donated more than **$450,000** year to date\! I want to thank each of you reading this for your contribution – we could not have done this without you\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Beginning today, treat everyone you meet as if they were going to be dead by midnight. Extend to them all the care, kindness and understanding you can muster, and do it with no thought of any reward. Your life will never be the same again.” - Og Mandino

“Thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared.” - Buddha

“A word of encouragement from a teacher to a child can change a life. A word of encouragement from a spouse can save a marriage. A word of encouragement from a leader can inspire a person to reach her potential.” - John C. Maxwell
