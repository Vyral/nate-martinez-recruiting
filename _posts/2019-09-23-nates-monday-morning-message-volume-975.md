## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 975**

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message\! This week, I want to share a quote from one of my favorite public figures, Tony Robbins: “One reason so few of us achieve what we truly want is that we never direct our focus; we never concentrate our power. Most people dabble their way through life, never deciding to master anything in particular.”

When I read this quote, there are two words that stand out the most and those are “power” and “mastery.” We are powerful beings, capable of doing and being whatever we can imagine possible, yet as this quote points out, most of us “dabble” our way through life, playing it safe or even worse, living in fear. Why is that?

I believe it is because we do not commit to mastery. The dictionary’s definition of the word “mastery” means to command the expert skill or knowledge. The only way we become a master of anything in life is to commit or focus our efforts 110+ percent. What can you do today to get out of fear and into mastery? What is one action you can take? Anything is possible…YOU are possible. So, dare to dream and dare to commit to mastery. Let’s make it a masterful week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

All the Difference in the World

Every Sunday morning, I take a light jog around a park near my home.&nbsp; There’s a lake located in one corner of the park.&nbsp; Each time I jog by this lake, I see the same elderly woman sitting at the water’s edge with a small metal cage sitting beside her.

This past Sunday my curiosity got the best of me, so I stopped jogging and walked over to her.&nbsp; As I got closer, I realized that the metal cage was in fact a small trap.&nbsp; There were three turtles, unharmed, slowly walking around the base of the trap.&nbsp; She had a fourth turtle in her lap that she was carefully scrubbing with a spongy brush.

“Hello,” I said.&nbsp; “I see you here every Sunday morning.&nbsp; If you don’t mind my nosiness, I’d love to know what you’re doing with these turtles.”

She smiled.&nbsp; “I’m cleaning off their shells,” she replied.&nbsp; “Anything on a turtle’s shell, like algae or scum, reduces the turtle’s ability to absorb heat and impedes its ability to swim.&nbsp; It can also corrode and weaken the shell over time.”

“Wow\!&nbsp; That’s really nice of you\!” I exclaimed.

She went on: “I spend a couple of hours each Sunday morning, relaxing by this lake and helping these little guys out.&nbsp; It’s my own strange way of making a difference.”

“But don’t most freshwater turtles live their whole lives with algae and scum hanging from their shells?” I asked.

“Yep, sadly, they do,” she replied.

I scratched my head.&nbsp; “Well then, don’t you think your time could be better spent?&nbsp; I mean, I think your efforts are kind and all, but there are fresh water turtles living in lakes all around the world.&nbsp; And 99% of these turtles don’t have kind people like you to help them clean off their shells.&nbsp; So, no offense… but how exactly are your localized efforts here truly making a difference?”

The woman giggled aloud.&nbsp; She then looked down at the turtle in her lap, scrubbed off the last piece of algae from its shell, and said, “Sweetie, if this little guy could talk, he’d tell you I just made all the difference in the world.”

The moral: &nbsp;You can change the world – maybe not all at once, but one person, one animal, and one good deed at a time.&nbsp; Wake up every morning and pretend like what you do makes a difference.&nbsp; It does.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“People who become 'elite' at what they do aren't striving to be 'elite' just to join some special club. They take great joy and satisfaction in the pursuit of mastery, and they compete against themselves, not others.” - Justine Musk

“Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear, not absence of fear.” - Mark Twain

“Only one who devotes himself to a cause with his whole strength and soul can be a true master. For this reason mastery demands all of a person.” - Albert Einstein
