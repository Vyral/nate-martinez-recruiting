## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 976**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…anything is possible, you are possible…did you commit to mastery this week? Did you commit to yourself; to your dreams and goals? Do you really believe that anything is possible? Or are you like many people who live in fear of pursuing their dreams and goals? Daily I see people within my company who are literally paralyzed by fear…fear of rejection, fear that they lack enough skill, fear that there isn’t enough business. So today, I’d like to share an acronym with you about the word fear.

FEAR:<br>(F) False<br>(E) Evidence<br>(R) Appearing<br>(R) Real

False evidence appearing real, just like anything we make-up in our minds, whether it is true or false, the feeling we attach to it, determines whether it is good or bad…or in other words, fear or happiness. Most people fail to realize that fear has the exact same emotional feeling in our bodies as excitement or happiness does. Fear can stop us dead in our tracks, while excitement can drive us to greatness. You get to decide…fear or excitement? I hope this week you choose excitement. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

The Elephant Rope

As a man was passing the elephants, he suddenly stopped, confused by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg. No chains, no cages. It was obvious that the elephants could, at any time, break away from their bonds but for some reason, they did not.

He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away. “Well,” trainer said, “when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.”

The man was amazed. These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they couldn’t, they were stuck right where they were.

Like the elephants, how many of us go through life hanging onto a belief that we cannot do something, simply because we failed at it once before?

Failure is part of learning; we should never give up the struggle in life.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Action is a great restorer and builder of confidence. Inaction is not only the result, but the cause, of fear. Perhaps the action you take will be successful; perhaps different action or adjustments will have to follow. But any action is better than no action at all.” – Norman Vincent Peale

“Fear is a powerful beast. But we can learn to ride it.” - Justine Musk

“I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.” - Nelson Mandela
