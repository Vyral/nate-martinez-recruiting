## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 977**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…last week we talked about fear and how to overcome those feelings. This week I’d like to focus on Q4 and how we can set ourselves up for a great 2020. I think a good practice for planning is taking inventory of what we did so far this year. Spend a few minutes looking at the great things that have already happened this year and all the amazing people who have come into our lives.

We use our past as a training ground for the future however, that can be limiting if we are using it as a benchmark for what we can or can not do. We want to learn from our past, but not let it control what we believe we can do, just because it has never been done before. We can all do, be and succeed at more; the sky is literally the limit. Dare to dream big and then go out and make it happen. I believe in you. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Building Your House - Author Unknown

An elderly carpenter was ready to retire. He told his employer-contractor of his plans to leave the house-building business to live a more leisurely life with his wife and enjoy his extended family. He would miss the paycheck each week, but he wanted to retire. They could get by.&nbsp;

The contractor was sorry to see his good worker go and asked if he could build just one more house as a personal favor. The carpenter said yes, but over time it was easy to see that his heart was not in his work. He resorted to shoddy workmanship and used inferior materials. It was an unfortunate way to end a dedicated career.&nbsp;

When the carpenter finished his work, his employer came to inspect the house. Then he handed the front-door key to the carpenter and said, “This is your house... my gift to you."

The carpenter was shocked\! What a shame\! If he had only known he was building his own house, he would have done it all so differently.&nbsp;

Success Principle:

So it is with us. We build our lives, a day at a time, often putting less than our best into the building. Then, with a shock, we realize we have to live in the house we have built. If we could do it over, we'd do it much differently.

But, you cannot go back. You are the carpenter, and every day you hammer a nail, place a board, or erect a wall. Someone once said, "Life is a do-it-yourself project." Your attitude, and the choices you make today, help build the "house" you will live in tomorrow. Build wisely\!

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.” - Helen Keller

“Once we believe in ourselves, we can risk curiosity, wonder, spontaneous delight, or any experience that reveals the human spirit.” - e. e. cummings

“The essential lesson I've learned in life is to just be yourself. Treasure the magnificent being that you are and recognize first and foremost you're not here as a human being only. You're a spiritual being having a human experience.” - Wayne Dyer
