## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 980**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…I hope this email finds you well-rested and refreshed for a new week\! Before we know it, the holiday season will be here and that got me thinking about what I love about this time of year, and the word gratitude came to mind…as we know gratitude is the theme for Thanksgiving but during the hustle and bustle, gratitude can quickly fade under stress.

Over the next few weeks, I’d like to challenge each of you to start your day with three things you are grateful for…and to up the accountability, I’d love for you to email them to me\! Let’s have some fun and create an attitude of gratitude throughout the month of November…I can’t wait to read your emails\! Let’s make it a great week\!

PS I’ll start the challenge by sharing three things I am grateful for:

1. The incredible people on my team, especially Kristine who is the glue that holds us together\!
2. Tonya – she continues to inspire me to be a better father, a better partner and a better man\!
3. My children – I am so blessed to have three healthy, smart and amazing children who complete my world\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Parable of the Pencil&nbsp;

The Pencil Maker took the pencil aside, just before putting him into the box. "There are five things you need to know," he told the pencil, "Before I send you out into the world, always remember them and never forget, and you will become the best pencil you can be." "One: You will be able to do many great things, but only if you allow yourself to be held in someone’s hand." "Two: You will experience a painful sharpening from time to time, but you'll need it to become a better pencil." "Three: You will be able to correct any mistakes you might make." "Four: The most important part of you will always be what's inside." "And, Five: On every surface you are used on, you must leave your mark. No matter what the condition, you must continue to write." The pencil understood and promised to remember and went into the box with purpose in its heart.

Now replace the place of the pencil with yourself. Always remember them and never forget, and you will become the best person you can be. One: You will be able to do many great things, but only if you allow yourself to be held in special hands and allow other human beings to access you for the many gifts you possess. Two: You will experience a painful sharpening from time to time, by going through various problems in life, but you'll need it to become a stronger person. Three: You will be able to correct any mistakes you might make.&nbsp; Four: The most important part of you will always be what's on the inside. And, Five: On every surface you walk through, you must leave your mark. No matter what the situation, you must continue to do your duties. Allow this parable on the pencil to encourage you to know that you are a special person and that only you can fulfill the purpose to which you were born to accomplish. Never allow yourself to get discouraged and think that your life is insignificant and cannot make a change.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend.” - Melody Beattie

“As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.” - John F. Kennedy

“Gratitude is one of the strongest and most transformative states of being. It shifts your perspective from lack to abundance and allows you to focus on the good in your life, which in turn pulls more goodness into your reality.” - Jen Sincero
