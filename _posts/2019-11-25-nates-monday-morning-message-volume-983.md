## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 983**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…This is the time of year that we should take a moment to consider what we have to be truly thankful for…down to the smallest gestures of kindness, to the rain that quenched our desert floor last week, to the fest that will be served this Thursday in most American homes (and some aboard for those celebrating outside the U.S.) Even if you are facing a difficult time, we can still be grateful for the loving people we know, the breath in our lungs and the opportunities that lie ahead in the New Year.

As we wrap up our month of gratitudes, I hope that this daily effort will carry forward into each and every day you have in the future. Let the people you care about, know how thankful you are for them; take time to reach everyone. Let them know what they mean to you and that you appreciate them in your life. Please enjoy this time, use it wisely as once its gone, it’s gone forever.

From my family and my team please let us be the first to wish you and your loved ones a very happy, healthy and safe Thanksgiving weekend celebration…let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Thanksgiving Day Poem, Author Unknown

The year has turned its circle,<br>The seasons come and go.

The harvest all is gathered in<br>And chilly north winds blow.

Orchards have shared their treasures,<br>The fields, their yellow grain.

So open wide the doorway,<br>Thanksgiving comes again\!

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“The thankful receiver bears a plentiful harvest.” – William Blake

“Thanksgiving Day is a good day to recommit our energies to giving thanks and just giving.”&nbsp; – Amy Grant

“An optimist is a person who starts a new diet on Thanksgiving Day.” - Irv Kupcinet

“If you think Independence Day is America's defining holiday, think again. Thanksgiving deserves that title, hands-down.” - Tony Snow

“We're getting ready to sit down at the table and have Thanksgiving, and there's people that are not with their families. There are people that are in dangerous areas, putting their lives on the line to keep our country free, and I think that's something we should all celebrate every day.” - Guy Fieri
