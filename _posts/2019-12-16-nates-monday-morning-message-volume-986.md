## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 986**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…I am sure all of you were very busy with holiday shopping, or parties, or just relaxing, or maybe even some work\! As the year wraps up, and we start to prepare for 2020 we should look at back at 2019 and be proud of what we accomplished. We should take some time this week to think about all of the hurdles and victories we faced this past year.

What I like most about business is that it is never ending and always changing. That is the same with life. We wake up each and every day and we plan, and we work and life comes our way. We must remember that we make choices each and every day and those choices are only ours. Many things have tried to throw us off course and many more will come. We should expect them and when they come we will be ready and we will handle them. The reason we look back is to remind ourselves how far we’ve come in the last twelve months.

Let’s move forward with more confidence, resolve, and determination to reach our goals in the New Year – and let us have some fun along the way\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Each Day I Learn More

Each day I learn more than I teach;<br>I learn that half knowledge of another's life<br>Leads to false judgment;<br>I learn that there is surprising kinship In human nature;<br>I learn that it's a wise father who knows his own son;<br>I learn that what we expect we get;<br>I learn there's more good than evil in this world;<br>That age is a question of spirit;<br>That youth is the best of life<br>No matter how numerous the years;<br>I learn how much there is to learn.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.” - Steve Jobs

“Our lives are a sum total of the choices we have made.” – Wayne Dyer

“One's philosophy is not best expressed in words; it is expressed in the choices one makes… and the choices we make are ultimately our responsibility.” - Eleanor Roosevelt
