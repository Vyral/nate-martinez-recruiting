## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 989**

Welcome to the first Nate’s Monday Morning Message of 2020\! I hope that each of you reading this had a wonderful holiday season…it’s a new year and that means its time for new goals and resolutions. However, setting a new goal or resolving to stop a bad habit is only one component of change. In order to succeed you also need to be focused.

If you desire to have better relationships, focus on being more present in the moment with those people. If you desire more confidence, focus on your self-image and the great things you have to share. If you desire more money, focus on continually doing the tasks you identified that will produce revenue and not the mundane nonsense of running your business. Focus is differentiators. Lots and lots of people can come up with a plan. Lots and lots of people have desires. The challenge for many is the focus needed to do what is needed day after day without getting thrown off track.

I’d love to know your goals for 2020\! If you’d like to share them with me, shoot me back an email and if there is anything I can do to support you in the New Year, I’d love to help. Let’s make it a great week\!

PS I want to give a big shout out to our very own Treedah Magee\! Her annual holiday toy drive to benefit Phoenix Children’s Hospital was another smashing success. Thank you Treedah for your vision and support for our local kids – your generous heart is so appreciated by all of us at RE/MAX Professionals and every family that you touch during the holiday season\!
