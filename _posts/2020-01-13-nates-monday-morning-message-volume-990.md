## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 990**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! Today I’d like to share a story about a recent client we helped buy a home. Every REALTOR&reg; (myself included) is quick to posts on social media about the listings that sell in hours for thousand above asking price, but we rarely share the stories that are not so easy. We think that posting about those quick sales makes us look good; however, our value comes from the transactions that are not easy or fast - and reminds our clients why they need an agent to represent them.

I received a referral a few days before Christmas from a RE/MAX agent out of state. She referred us her brother who was hired to run a large company here in the Valley. Time was of the essence as his home in California was in escrow and due to close the second week of January; with the holidays in full swing we had to act fast.

The buyer had some special needs which included a home with an acre of land, single level, room for three boys (one with special needs), four large dogs and priced in the $500,000 range – and they needed to be in by January 6th. Tonya and I went to work fast finding a home in Buckeye and after several days of negotiations we could not put the deal together, as the seller of that property could not move out that fast. So, we found another home, and the same thing happened.

We found a third property in New River and got an offer accepted on Christmas Eve and managed to get the inspection done the day after Christmas. A big shout out to our partners at Advantage Home Inspection for acting fast and helping our client\! The next few days were very stressful as the listing agent had not sold a home in a long time, or perhaps never from what I could tell. She had a “DPS” destination (deal preventative specialist), and we just couldn’t get on the same page with repairs and paperwork.

My client paid for the inspection and paid for a rush appraisal to expedite the process. It became clear that we needed to find a backup, so on New Year’s Eve we made an offer on a fourth property, countered back and forth – and the buyer had to make a choice to cancel the contract on a home they loved, risk it not closing or move onto the next property. We canceled the offer on the New River property and accepted the counter on the other property on January 2nd.

I am happy to conclude this story by telling you we were able to hand our client the keys so they could move in – on January 6th\! Many people think that real estate is as easy as watching a show on HGTV. Its not and in fact, it is the hardest job there is trying to handle many personalities, stress, negotiations, unprofessionalism, and high demands to hit sometimes unrealistic timelines. I am so grateful for our amazing team of experts (inspectors, lenders, title company) and a shout out to the listing agent on this property for being fast and professional in helping us put this deal together.

As a company, we are truly blessed and honored to serve many clients at a high level; most of us rely on referral business like this client. I love the easy deals, but I especially love the ones that we have an opportunity to go above and beyond to take care of our clients. This week I’d like to challenge each of you to share a story on your social media about a deal that wasn’t so easy. Let’s demonstrate our value through a different perspective. Let’s make it a great week\!
