<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’m sharing why your average commission may have risen by $2,000 in the last five years.</em></p>

I have exceptional news for you: Did you know that over the last five years your average commission per transaction increased by $2,000? Back in 2015, the average commission was roughly $7,000. Today, it’s up to $9,000 per transaction. Those numbers are coming from the median price in Maricopa County.&nbsp;

In 2015 the average home value was $233,000. Every year since saw an increase, and in 2019 the average value was $306,500. I’ve been in real estate for 33 years, and that’s the highest median price I’ve ever seen. **Overall, the median price has risen by 31.5% in the last five years.** This, of course, helped to increase your commission.&nbsp;

What are you doing with that extra commission? Do you own real estate? If you bought a property back in 2015 for $233,000, it would possibly be worth $306,000 today. That’s a considerable boost.&nbsp;
