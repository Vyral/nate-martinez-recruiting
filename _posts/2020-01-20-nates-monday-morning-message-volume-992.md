## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 992**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! It was a somber ending to the weekend as the world learned the tragic news of the helicopter crash that took NBA Basketball Player, Kobe Bryant and his beautiful daughter Gianna. My son was only six years old when Kobe joined the basketball league and he was Nate Jr.’s favorite player, so much that the number eight was his number in the sports he played and when that wasn’t available it was the number twenty-four.

Whether you were a fan or not, Kobe left a mark on the basketball world, the community he served, his family and so many others. This tragedy is a reminder that life is precious, and we just never know when it might end. Let it be a reminder that each day is a gift. Let it be a reminder that we have so much potential and so much to give the world if we let our light shine. Let it be a reminder to live life on your terms. Sending each of you much love and peace. Hug your families, share your kindness and compassion for those around you. Let’s make it a great week\! \#RIPMamba

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

I will tell you a story of my friend Monty Roberts.

As he was a kid, his father as a horse trainer was moving from stable to stable, from ranch to ranch, training horses. Thus, the boy‘s school career was constantly interrupted. One day, when he was a senior, teacher asked him to write about what he wanted to be when he grew up. He did not hesitate a minute and wrote seven-page paper about his aim to be an owner of a horse ranch, he wrote many details and drew a location of buildings and stables and even a detailed house plan.

Two days later he received his paper back with letter “F” on the front page. After class he came to teacher and asked: “Why did I receive an F?” The teacher responded: “This dreams is so unrealistic for a boy like you, who has no money, no resources and who comes from itinerant family. There is no possibility that you will reach your great goals one day.” &nbsp;Then the teacher offered to rewrite the paper with more realistic attitude.

The boy went home and asked his father, how he should act. The father answered: “This decision is very important for you. So you have to make your own mind on this.”

After several days the boy brought the same paper to his teacher. No changes were made. He said: “Keep the F and I will keep my dream.”

Now Monty Roberts owns 4,000-square-foot house in the middle of 200-acre horse ranch and he still has that school paper, which now is framed over the fireplace.

Remember, you have to follow your heart, never give up, move on with determination and persistence, and never let anyone take your dreams away.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“I don't want to be the next Michael Jordan, I only want to be Kobe Bryant.” – Kobe Bryant

“I have self-doubt. I have insecurity. I have fear of failure. I have nights when I show up at the arena and I'm like, 'My back hurts, my feet hurt, my knees hurt. I don't have it. I just want to chill.' We all have self-doubt. You don't deny it, but you also don't capitulate to it. You embrace it.” - Kobe Bryant

“Winning takes precedence over all. There's no gray area. No almosts.” - Kobe Bryant
