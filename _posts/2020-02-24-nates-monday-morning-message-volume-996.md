## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 996**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…this week I’d like to remind you the value of a team. There is not one person on this earth who can do everything themselves. When we associate ourselves with people that have the same mindset, goals, dreams, and determination we all become collectively stronger.

Look around you this week and decide if you are doing everything you can to make the people around you better. Are they doing the same for you? Life is more than a two-way street. There are twists and turns, bumps and potholes, red lights and even stop signs. Are you surrounded by people that will help you every step of the way? Are you prepared to do your part in return? Let’s embrace the help of others, while giving more than we get\! Let’s make it a great week\!
