## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 999**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…in just a few short days, the world as we know it has forever been changed by the outbreak of Coronavirus. However, in every dark moment, there is light and as community its important that we try to calm the panic, find compassion and patience as we navigate this new “normal.”

As this last week unfolded, I was reminded how important it is to slow down, smile at a stranger (they need it), have a sense of humor (you need it) and don’t forget your manners by saying please and thank you. In one of my favorite books, The Greatest Salesman in the World written by Og Mandino he writes that “this too shall pass” and while things are uncertain today, this too shall pass – and perhaps something good will come of it. For now, I am going to stay positive, smile and choose to be the best person I can be. I’d like to encourage you to do the same. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

24 Thoughts Never to Forget…

Your presence is a present to the world. You're unique and one of a kind. Your life can be what you want it to be.

Take the days just one at a time. Count your blessings, not your troubles. You'll make it through whatever comes along. Within you are so many answers. Understand, have courage, be strong.

Don't put limits on yourself. So many dreams are waiting to be realized. Decisions are too important to leave to chance.

Reach for your peak, your goal, your prize. Nothing wastes more energy than worrying. The longer one carries a problem, the heavier it gets.

Don't take things too seriously. Live a life of serenity, not a life of regrets. Remember that a little love goes a long way…Remember that a lot…goes forever. Remember that friendship is a wise investment.

Life's treasures are people…together. Realize that it's never too late. Do ordinary things in an extraordinary way. Have health and hope and happiness.

Take time to wish upon a star. And don't ever forget…for even a day…How very special you are.&nbsp;

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“I love the man that can smile in trouble, that can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. 'Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but he whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves his conduct, will pursue his principles unto death.” - Thomas Paine

“It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.” – Aristotle

“Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.” - Steve Jobs
