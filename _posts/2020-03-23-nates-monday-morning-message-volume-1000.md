## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,000**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…what a wild ride it has been with the continued spread of the Covid19 outbreak\! At RE/MAX Professionals, we took swift action including sending our employees home and implementing safety measures for all our clients who currently have their homes on the market or those who are actively looking to purchase. The question I have been asked the most over the last week…how’s the market?

Despite the pandemic, RE/MAX Professionals was able to successfully close thirty-eight transactions, negotiated contracts on thirty-six homes and listed for sale another twenty-two homes. Our company and our agents are working hard and ready to help you and your loved ones safely navigate these uncertain, unprecedented times. We are here to help, however we can.

If you or someone you know is struggling to find essential supplies or in need of help getting medications, etc. please reach out to me directly. We are all in this together\! Stay safe and healthy, and let’s try to remember, this too shall pass. &nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

One evening I was going back from a supermarket. As I have approached my car, I noticed that some person came and stood beside me. He was the one that could be considered as a bum. It seemed that he had no car, no home and no job. I expected that he will ask me for money, but he did not do that, he only said: “Your car is very nice.”

After several moments of silence, I have replied: “Thanks” and then the inner voice told me: “Ask him if he needs help.” After a short hesitation I have asked him, if he needs any help. His respond was astonishing, I will never forget those simple three words that I heard from him: “Don‘t we all?”

It was a true discovery to me. I needed help. Although I had money and a place to sleep, but I recognized that I needed help too. Then I have opened my wallet and gave him enough money to get a meal and some shelter for a day.

Suddenly I understood that no matter how much money, achievements, luxury things do we have, we all need help. And on the other hand, no matter how poor you are, how many material problems you have, you still might offer your help to others, you still might be giving. Even it‘s just a nice word, you can give that and it can be priceless to other person.

Maybe that man was just a homeless stranger, but to me he was more than that. Maybe he was sent by the Highest Loving Power personally to me, to open my eyes, to show me that there is one thing, among all other values and achievements, which is very important and irreplaceable for each and every person. Actually, it is a true gift and it is called giving.
