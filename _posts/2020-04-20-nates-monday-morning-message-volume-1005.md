## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,005**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…the summer temps have arrived in the Valley of the Sun, and I hope this email finds you navigating the pandemic with a little more grace and understanding than last week. I am sure you, just like my family are looking forward to the weeks that lie ahead when we can begin to return to some normality. The Phoenix real estate market is still moving, with more than 14,000 active homes on the market and nearly 9,800 homes went under contract\!

We are resilient, strong and innovative which creates unique and different opportunities to learn, grow and become better humans, and a better community. I believe there are opportunities everywhere we look if we are open and willing to see. What opportunities are in your life? Let’s make it a great week\!&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

One day a farmer found an eagle’s egg and brought it home. He placed the eagle’s egg together with some chicken eggs to be hatched. The little eagle was hatched together with the other chicks. He began his life like the other chicks and the mother hen. He followed the ways of the chicken. He ate, walked, crowed, and moved like all the other chickens. One day an eagle flying nearby saw the little eagle mingling together with the chickens. He flew down to talk to the young eagle. All the chickens ran away because they were terrified of the eagle. The young eagle also tried to run but was stopped by the adult eagle. The adult eagle asked, “What are you doing here with the chickens? You are an eagle just like me. You can fly like me and your home is high up among the cliffs”. The young eagle said, “I am a chicken, and this is where I belong, together with the other chickens. See, I cannot fly\!” The adult eagle then grabbed the eagle in his claws, and with all his might proceeded to fly to the nearby cliffs. The adult eagle said, “I am going to teach you how to fly.” The flying lesson began and to his bewilderment, the young eagle discovered that he could fly. Of course, he fell many times before succeeding. He discovered his true self with the help of the adult eagle, and never again went back to the chickens. We are all born eagles and are able to soar high into the heavens. We are not chickens that stay on the ground looking for food, just for the day. We have a higher potential within us, and we should realize it. In fact, we should be successful like the adult eagle, so that we can in turn teach other young eagles, who think they are chickens to fly.&nbsp;

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“The pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity. The optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.” – Winston Churchill

“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.” – Thomas Edison

“When written in Chinese, the word 'crisis' is composed of two characters. One represents danger and the other represents opportunity.” – John F. Kennedy
