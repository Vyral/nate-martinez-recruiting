## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,007**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…I hope that each of you found a unique and creative way to celebrate the special moms in your life. I am so grateful for my own mother, Tonya, my daughter Brandi and my future daughter-in-law Ashely for everything they represent for our family. Every Mother’s Day I am reminded that we should be celebrating these amazing women in our lives more often, and during these uncertain times it is amazing to witness the strength and resilience of these women who are now teachers, caregivers and so much more. This week let’s keep the appreciation going for all the beautiful, strong women in our lives who make the world a better place. Let’s make it a great week\!&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Time - We all have 24 hours\!

Are you usually punctual or late? Do you finish things within the time you stipulate? Do you hand in your reports/work on time? Are you able to accomplish what you want to do before deadlines? Are you a good time manager?

If your answer is “no” to any of the questions above, that means you’re not managing your time as well as you want. Here are 20 tips on how to be a better time manager:

Create a daily plan.<br>Peg a time limit to each task.<br>Use a calendar.<br>Use an organizer.<br>Know your deadlines.<br>Learn to say “No.”<br>Target to be early.<br>Time box your activities.<br>Have a clock visibly placed before you.<br>Set reminders 15 minutes before.<br>Focus.<br>Block out distractions.<br>Track your time spent.<br>Don’t fuss about unimportant details.<br>Prioritize.<br>Delegate.<br>Batch similar tasks together.<br>Eliminate your time wasters.<br>Cut off when you need to.<br>Leave buffer time in-between.
