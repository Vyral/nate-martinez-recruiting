## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,010**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…this week I am excited to share the newest addition to our family, Nathan Gabriel Martinez\! And I wanted to give a big shout out to my son, Nathan Jr. and his fianc&eacute; Ashley for creating a perfect little boy who was born early Saturday morning. Our family is so blessed to welcome the first grandson into the circle, and we can’t wait to spoil him rotten\! New life is precious and it’s a reminder of the most important things we possess, aren’t material but the love of your family. This week, I’d like to challenge you to give a little extra love to those around you. Let’s make it a great week\!&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

To Nathan and Ashley, a poem for your new baby boy:

You’ve loved him<br>Longer than he knows<br>I can’t wait until he grows<br>You will show him<br>To walk, to talk, how to say “Hello”<br>You’ll show him more love than he will ever know<br>You’ll teach him a firm handshake<br>And how to show respect<br>He is such a lucky boy<br>To have parents so caring and loving<br>He is now part of a family<br>That will be there through thick and thin<br>Congratulations on your bundle of love<br>I wish nothing but the best for him\!
