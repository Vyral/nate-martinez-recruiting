## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,012**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…I hope this email finds each of you well and ready to embrace a new day, a new week and new opportunities that are waiting for you. Every day we get to reset and start new and every day is full of unique and amazing opportunities. When we dream big, we can live big and that is where the magic is. What do you dream about doing in your life? Today is the day. Let’s make it a great week\!&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Today is My Day

Today my thoughts are centered on expecting only the best and giving only the best. Today my mind and heart are open to new opportunities and I make the most out of every situation.

Today I will smile and act enthusiastically in everything I do. I will make every person I meet feel very important and I will show them that I care. Today my confidence is high, and I am willing to step out and take a chance. I speak freely to all those I meet. I know I have something valuable to contribute. I expect results today and my time is well invested.

Today I am one step closer to achieving my goals and dreams. I always keep my eyes focused on success and prosperity. Today I will sow good seed so that I will reap my harvest of reward.&nbsp;

Today is my day\!
