<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This is how we show homes during and after lockdown.</em></p>

Lockdowns are easing, but the coronavirus is still making people sick, so how can you show listings during and post-lockdown?&nbsp;

**When the pandemic hit the U.S., we stepped up our marketing game.** For higher-end homes, we hire professional photographers who take daylight, evening, and sunset photos. We make videos and added 3D Matterport tours. We wanted to give people the option of walking through a house without physically being there, and make them feel comfortable.

As an example of what we do, we had a seller contact us because they were canceling their listing with their previous real estate agent, as they weren’t providing good enough service. We got together in a Zoom call, and I gave them a complete listing presentation and showed them examples of our Matterport videos. We decided to price the property at $675,000 and luckily were able to host a physical open house because restrictions had been eased by then.

We took all precautions including masks, gloves, antiseptic wipes, and kept all doors open. We also did a lot of digital marketing for the open house. One of the buyers that came made a full-price offer, and now we’re in escrow. That home was on the market for less than a week. Today we also received a backup offer on the house.&nbsp;

The right property, price, location, and marketing will get a home sold. In today’s market, we need to go the extra mile for our sellers.&nbsp;

If there’s anything I can do to help you, including showing you how to use Zoom or showing you some of our marketing, I’d be glad to do so. I have 34 years of real estate experience, and **my goal is to help other agents get better.&nbsp;**

If you have questions about marketing or anything else, call or email me. I’d be happy to speak with you.
