## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,014**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…I hope this email finds you well and refreshed from the weekend. The summer temps are on the rise and that means summer is in full swing with Independence Day right around the corner. As we prepare to celebrate our great nation, I hope you will take a moment with your family and friends to remember what it means to be an American. Now more than ever, it is important to remember what makes our country the greatest in the world and what we had to do to get here and what it takes to protect our future. Our freedom wasn’t free, and we must never forget that. Happy Fourth of July\! Let’s make it a great week\!&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

A Nation's Strength by William Ralph Emerson

What makes a nation's pillars high<br>And its foundations strong?<br>What makes it mighty to defy<br>The foes that round it throng?

It is not gold. Its kingdoms grand<br>Go down in battle shock;<br>Its shafts are laid on sinking sand,<br>Not on abiding rock.

Is it the sword? Ask the red dust<br>Of empires passed away;<br>The blood has turned their stones to rust,<br>Their glory to decay.

And is it pride? Ah, that bright crown<br>Has seemed to nations sweet;<br>But God has struck its luster down<br>In ashes at his feet.

Not gold but only men can make<br>A people great and strong;<br>Men who for truth and honor's sake<br>Stand fast and suffer long.

Brave men who work while others sleep,<br>Who dare while others fly…<br>They build a nation's pillars deep<br>And lift them to the sky.
