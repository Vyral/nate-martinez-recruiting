<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Interest rates are vital in real estate. Here’s why.</em></p>

Interest rate fluctuations are always a necessary topic in real estate. Last August, interest rates reached the low to mid-threes, but in June of last year, they were still up around 4.5%. **This April, interest rates were the lowest they’ve been in 30 years at 3.5%.&nbsp;**

One of our lenders recently quoted rates as low as 2.5% on a 30-year fixed mortgage. For comparison, when I bought my first house about 40 years ago, I paid approximately an 11% interest rate.&nbsp;

Let’s say a property costs $430,000 with a 3.5% interest rate; the payment would be $1,931 per month, not including taxes or insurance. Last year, with interest rates around 4.5%, the payment for that same property would be $2,179— $248 more per month than the lower interest rate, which is almost $3,000 more per year. Compared to a year ago, this gives buyers $50,000 more in buying power. **Those are great savings for people buying today.**
