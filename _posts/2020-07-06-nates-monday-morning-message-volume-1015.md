## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,015**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…I hope this email finds you well and refreshed from a long holiday weekend\! It was great to spend quality time with our family, and I hope that you found a safe and fun way to celebrate the freedoms our great country offers. This week, I want to talk about opportunities. In every dark cloud, there is a silver lining. In every challenge there is something to be learned. In every tragedy, there is something beautiful. I think you can agree that right now we are facing many interesting and unique challenges, however I’d like to encourage you to think outside the box. How can we turn these challenges into opportunities? What is the silver lining in your life? Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

The Parable of the Taoist Farmer

There was once a farmer in ancient China who owned a horse. “You are so lucky\!” his neighbors told him, “to have a horse to pull the cart for you.” “Maybe,” the farmer replied.

One day he didn’t latch the gate properly and the horse ran away. “Oh no\! That is terrible news\!” his neighbors cried. “Such bad luck\!” “Maybe,” the farmer replied.

A few days later the horse returned, bringing with it two wild horses. “How fantastic\! You are so lucky,” his neighbors told him. “Maybe,” the farmer replied.

The following week the farmer’s son was breaking-in one of the wild horses when it threw him to the ground, breaking his leg. “Oh no\!” the neighbors cried. “Such bad luck, all over again\!” “Maybe,” the farmer replied.

The next day soldiers came and took away all the young men to fight in the army. The farmer’s son was left behind. “You are so lucky\!” his neighbors cried. “Maybe,” the farmer replied.

When we interpret a situation as an ‘opportunity’ or a ‘disaster’ it shapes the way that we respond.

But the Taoist Farmer shows that we can never truly know how a situation is going to turn out. There are no intrinsic ‘opportunities’ or ‘threats’ — there is only what happens and how we choose to respond.

In which case, doesn’t it make sense to look for the opportunities in every situation?
