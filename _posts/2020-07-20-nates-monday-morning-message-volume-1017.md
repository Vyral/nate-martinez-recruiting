## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,017**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message and another week filled with countless opportunities\! I hope that you were able to recharge over the weekend and that each of you reading this is healthy and safe. I found the poem below while preparing for this email, and I thought it was relevant for the climate we are in. There is no goal to extreme…Let’s make it a great week\!&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

The Workings of a Successful Mind by Devin McMillan,&nbsp;

The powers of the mind are not fixed<br>and science can never explain<br>What makes a person a success<br>yet leaves another so mundane.

For whatever the mind can conceive<br>with enough thought it will deliver.<br>There is no goal too extreme<br>when your mind is a benevolent giver.

Take risks in your daily life<br>or you can conform like the rest<br>Since rewards are only granted to<br>those who have passed this test.

Know that you have the power<br>to succeed in numerous ways<br>Or you can play it safe<br>being mediocre for all of your days.

So keep positive in all you do<br>wielding your list of goals in hand<br>Fear not what others say<br>just focus on your plan.

Enjoy every breath that passes<br>and every task there is to do<br>Since your actions will only play<br>the goals you have placed in cue.

And always remember to gift<br>a little of everything you make<br>For life is defined by giving<br>and never by what you take.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.” - Heraclitus

“You can't depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus.” - Mark Twain

“Every man gotta right to decide his own destiny." – Bob Marley
