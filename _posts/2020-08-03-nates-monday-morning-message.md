## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,019**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you refreshed and ready to bring on a new week full of new opportunities (and hopefully lower temperatures\!). Every day is a new opportunity, despite the challenges we face in our world right now. There is always something to be grateful for, something to be excited about and something worthy of sharing because it makes a positive difference. As we prepare ourselves for the return of school (however that may look), I encourage you to practice good self-care, take a break from the news, eat well, get plenty of sleep and keep yourself hydrated. Let’s make it a great week\!&nbsp;

PS You are Invited\! Please mark your calendar for **Friday, August 14th at 5pm** so you can join us for a **live streaming concert featuring local talent, Throwing Fitz** to benefit our fundraising efforts which will support **Phoenix Children’s Hospital for the Month of Miracles.

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Echo or Life

"A son and his father were walking on the mountains. Suddenly, his son falls, hurts himself and screams, “AAAhhhhhhhhhhh\!” To his surprise, he hears a voice repeating, somewhere in the mountain, “AAAhhhhhhhhhhh\!" Curious, he yells, "Who are you?” He receives the answer, "Who are you?” Angered at the response, he screams, “Coward\!" He receives the answer, "Coward\!"

He looks to his father and asks, "What's going on?” The father smiles and says, "My son, pay attention.” And then he screams to the mountain, “I admire you\!” The voice answers, “I admire you\!” Again, the father screams, "You are a champion\!” The voice answers, "You are a champion\!”&nbsp;

The boy is surprised but does not understand. Then the father explains, "People call this echo, but really this is life. It gives you back everything you say or do. Our life is simply a reflection of our actions. If you want more love in the world, create more love in your heart. If you want more competence in your team, improve your competence. This relationship applies to everything, in all aspects of life; Life will give you back everything you have given to it.”

“Your life is not a coincidence. It’s a reflection of you\!" &nbsp;- Unknown Author

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.” - Maya Angelou

“Everyone has inside of him a piece of good news. The good news is that you don't know how great you can be\! How much you can love\! What you can accomplish\! And what your potential is\!” - Anne Frank

“We must let go of the life we have planned, so as to accept the one that is waiting for us.” - Joseph Campbell
