## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,020**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! I want to give a big shout out to all the kids, parents and teachers who survived the first week of “virtual” school – and for those of you who might be starting this week. I know in my house, the first day of school for Mila was a lot different than last year, and certainly not what we had hoped for this year. However, challenges like this give us an opportunity to think outside the box, innovate, adapt, and overcome – but not without some patience and grace. This week let’s focus on taking a deep breath in those overwhelming moments and practicing the art of patience. We are in this together. Let’s make it a great week\!&nbsp;

PS You are Invited\! Please mark your calendar for **Friday, August 14th at 5pm** so you can join us for a **live streaming concert featuring local talent, Throwing Fitz** to benefit our fundraising efforts which will support **Phoenix Children’s Hospital for the Month of Miracles.

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

[PATIENCE](https://hellopoetry.com/poem/1019717/patience/) written by Oguh Stanley

PATIENCE is one virtue so rare<br>That is often missing in our daily affair

PATIENCE is a companion of wisdom<br>He who has it stands among kings in any kingdom<br>It is an habit that cannot be thrown out of the window<br>Without it lives you in a place of limbo

PATIENCE is not just how long we wait<br>But how we behave while we wait<br>It is a virtue of grace put together to make a pretty face<br>One year of patience equals ten years of peace

PATIENCE is the key to contentment<br>That locks every gate of resentment<br>One ounce of patience is more than pounds of brains<br>Investing in the bank of patience yield no loss but more gains

PATIENCE makes lighter what impatience may not heal<br>Driving through a narrow road but on a balance wheel<br>A heart fuel with patience drives with an unseen speed<br>It might be a soar fruit but with a sweet seed

PATIENCE is truly a virtue acquire it if you can<br>It will make you a good father, a better mother and a perfect human
