## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,022**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you well and staying hydrated from the summer temps\! I don’t know about you, but our family enjoyed the storm the other night and hope for more before the monsoon season comes to an end. It has definitely been a very warm summer here in the Valley of the Sun. As we navigate the excessive heat, back to school struggles and pandemic, I want to challenge you to take a deep breath before you respond, especially on social media. Its okay to practice the pause before you respond to someone or something – the pause gives us time to collect our thoughts, evaluate our feelings and find a bit of compassion. This week let’s practice the pause together and make it a great week\!

**PS** We have broken the $15,000 mark towards our goal of $20,000 to benefit the Month of Miracles – THANK YOU for your donations and support\! We have one more fundraising opportunity going on through August 31st at 5pm.

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

A group of frogs were traveling through the woods, and two of them fell into a deep pit. When the other frogs saw how deep the pit was, they told the two frogs that they were as good as dead. The two frogs ignored the comments and tried to jump up out of the pit with all their might. The other frogs kept telling them to stop, that they were as good as dead. Finally, one of the frogs took heed to what the other frogs were saying and gave up. He fell down and died.The other frog continued to jump as hard as he could. Once again, the crowd of frogs yelled at him to stop the pain and just die. He jumped even harder and finally made it out. When he got out, the other frogs said, "Did you not hear us?" The frog explained to them that he was deaf. He thought they were encouraging him the entire time.

This story teaches two lessons:

1\. There is power of life and death in the tongue. An encouraging word to someone who is down can lift them up and help them make it through the day.

2\. A destructive word to someone who is down can be what it takes to kill them. Be careful of what you say.

Speak life to those who cross your path. The power of words…it is sometimes hard to understand that an encouraging word can go such a long way. Anyone can peak words that tend to rob another of the spirit to continue in difficult times. Special is the individual who will take the time to encourage another. Author Unknown
