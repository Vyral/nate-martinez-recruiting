Here’s my latest full conversation with my good friend Travis Zimmerman.

I recently had the opportunity to sit down with Travis Zimmerman of Blank Insurance to talk about several different topics.&nbsp;

He got a text recently from a good friend at a home warranty company who said that July 2020 was their best revenue month in the history of the company. However, it was also the lowest profit margin that they’ve ever had. Due to scarcity, **the frequency of claims is up, replace vs. repair is up, and the average cost per claim is up.**

I know great service, and Travis Zimmerman is a great service provider. I remember back when he was doing repairs in Sun City, got into the property management world, and how he continues to help me and our clients to this day.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
