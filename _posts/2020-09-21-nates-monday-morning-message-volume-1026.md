## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,026**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you healthy and in good spirits as we prepare to embrace a new week. Its almost the end of the third quarter and tomorrow marks the first official day of fall. Although, here in Phoenix the lingering triple digit temperatures make it a little difficult to get excited about pumpkins and apple spice\! However, fall is a perfect time to take inventory of the year so far, reflect on what went right, what could be improved on and what success looks like for 2021.

I want to stress the importance of focusing on what went right this year – I know for many of us there was plenty that happened around the pandemic which has caused an immense amount of stress and anxiety – but I would like to challenge you to find the positives, the silver linings and the moments that brought joy to your life. What we focus on, grows. What we pay attention to, is our reality. If we want to feel better, we need to focus on what makes us feel better. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

One day two woodcutters have argued, which of them will cut more wood during a day. In the morning two men took up their positions. First, they worked at one speed. But in an hour one of them has heard, that the other one stopped cutting trees. Realizing that this was his chance, the first woodcutter started to cut trees with double efforts.

Ten minutes passed, and he heard that the second woodcutter started to work again. They were working almost synchronously, when the first woodcutter heard that his opponent has stopped again. The first woodcutter continued working, feeling the smell of victory.

This lasted all day long. Each hour one of the woodcutters stopped for ten minutes and the other one continued to work. When time expired, the first woodcutter, who worked without any stopping, was absolutely sure that he won the prize.

He was very surprised to know that was mistaken. How did that happen? He asked his partner, “Each hour I heard that you have stopped the work for ten minutes. How could you cut more trees than I? It’s impossible\!”

“It is very simple, in fact,” answered the second woodcutter. “Each hour I stopped the work for ten minutes. And when you were cutting the trees, I sharpened the axe.”
