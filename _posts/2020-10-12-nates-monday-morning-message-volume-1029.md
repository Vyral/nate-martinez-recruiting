## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,029**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you well and refreshed from the weekend. We have spent a few weeks now talking about opportunities and taking inventory of the year so far and there is still time to crush your goals in Q4. However today, I want to remind you about the importance of practicing self-care. There is a lot coming at us from all different directions, and emotions and stress levels are on high alert. Taking time each day to take care of you first is critical. There is a reason that they flight attendants tell you to put your mask on first, in the event of an emergency before helping those around you. If you can’t breathe, you can’t help anyone else, especially your loved ones. I challenge each of you to take fifteen minutes each day this week and practice self-care\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

God Make Me a TV

Students at an elementary school were asked to write an essay about what they would like God to do for them. At the end of the day, while grading the essays, a teacher read one that made her very emotional.

Her husband, who had just walked in, saw her crying and asked her "What happened?" She answered "Read this. It is one of my school's students' essays:"

"Oh God, tonight I ask you something very special. Make me into a television set. I want to take its place and live like the TV in my house.

Have my own special place, and have my family around me. To be taken seriously when I talk. I want to be the center of attention and be heard without interruptions or questions.

I want to receive the same special care as the TV set receives even when it is not working. Have the company of my dad when he arrives home from work, even when he is tired. And I want my mom to want me when she is sad and upset, instead of ignoring me. And I want my brothers to fight to be with me.

I want to feel that family just leaves everything aside, every now and then, just to spend some time with me. And last but not least, ensure that I can make them all happy and entertain them. Lord I don't ask you for much. I just want to live like a TV."

At that moment the husband said "My God, poor kid. What horrible parents\!"

The wife looked up at him and said, "That essay is our son's\!"
