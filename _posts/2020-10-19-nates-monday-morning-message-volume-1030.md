## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,030**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! I hope that you found time this week to practice a little self-care and that you are ready to embrace another week. It’s hard to believe that there are only 73 more days left in 2020\! I know many of us are counting the days before we hit the New Year, however, I’d like to challenge you to use this time wisely, because we will never get it back. And while I know that 2020 has been full of unexpected and unprecedented events, there is still a life to be lived, countless opportunities and plenty of abundance and happiness if we look for it. Let’s make every single minute count\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

The Elephant Rope

As a man was passing the elephants, he suddenly stopped, confused by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg. No chains, no cages. It was obvious that the elephants could, at any time, break away from their bonds but for some reason, they did not.

He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away. “Well,” trainer said, “when they are very young and much smaller, we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.”

The man was amazed. These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they couldn’t, they were stuck right where they were.

Like the elephants, how many of us go through life hanging onto a belief that we cannot do something, simply because we failed at it once before?

Moral of the story: No matter how much the world tries to hold you back, always continue with the belief that what you want to achieve is possible.
