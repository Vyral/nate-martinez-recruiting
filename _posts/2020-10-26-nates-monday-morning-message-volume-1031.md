## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,031**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! Its finally feeling like fall in the Valley of the Sun and just in time for the spooky ghouls and goblins who only come out during Halloween\! I know that things look a little different this year for most of us leading into the holiday season, however, I want to remind you that we still have much to be grateful for. Instead of focusing on what we can’t do, let’s make it an opportunity to find unique and creative ways to celebrate while navigating the current climate. Let’s make it a great week – happy Halloween\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Mystic Magination Night\! Written by Patricia L. Cisco

On one mystic, magic night,<br>Jack O Lanterns glowing<br>with bags of candy sweet,<br>roam door to door and street to street,<br>all dressed up for trick or treat\!

Wizards with wands, pirates with hooks,<br>monsters and clowns with spooky looks,

kings and queens with capes and crowns,<br>a princess in her royal gown,

witches with warts and fairies with wings<br>movies stars with sparkling rings,

vampires with fangs that bite,<br>ghost that boo all dressed in white.

Imaginations taken flight,<br>on that one mystic, magic night.

Oh, the fun of Halloween,<br>be young or old or in between\!
