## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,033**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! What a week it has been for our great country – I hope that each of you reading this are safe and well – and ready to start another week as we round out 2020. I have been in the real estate industry for nearly 35 years, and one thing I know for certain, is that no matter who is in the White House, people still need assistance with their real estate needs. And we will remain committed to providing the excellent service you have come to expect, whether you are a client reading this or an agent in our brokerage or community.

We value our relationships and now more than ever we want you to know how much we appreciate you, your referrals and the loyalty of the agents who chose RE/MAX Professionals as their home. This week, I’d like to ask each of you to pay it forward – our world needs love and kindness so let’s be the light. Please make an extra effort to be that – hold a door open for an elder person at the store, call someone you haven’t talked to in a long time, help your neighbor with the weeds in their yard – whatever it might be, let’s do something that is an act of kindness in our community. And as always, let’s make it a great week\!

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone.” – Audrey Hepburn

“No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.” – Aesop

“I shall pass through this world but once. Any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness I can show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer it or neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.” - Stephen Grellet
