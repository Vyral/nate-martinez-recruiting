## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,034**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! We are quickly approaching the holiday season and while I know its going to look a lot different for many of us, there is still plenty to celebrate and be grateful for. I’d love to hear from you this week as to how you plan to celebrate\! I know there are unique ideas popping up every day and people finding ways to connect despite the pandemic, and I’d love to what you are planning to do. Let’s continue to focus our thoughts and actions on what we have to be grateful for and continue to be a bright light in our community and for our family and friends. And as always, let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

There are two branches of Gratitude. One is Gratefulness, and the other is Thanksgiving.

The Gratefulness branch is when the Bowl of Life is so full that it’s almost overflowing, but not quite. So full that it’s almost bowed at the top, but not quite dribbling over the edges. And, that is the experience of the Great Fullness of Life.

And when you’re in the Great Fullness of Life, you’re one with God, you’re one with the Universe, there is no “other.” And that is so Full Filling, that the Bowl of Life gives way and to overflow at last, which flows you directly over to the second branch, that of Thanksgiving.

When you’re in the space of Thanksgiving, the Bowl of Life is absolutely overflowing. You’re so grateful that there is an “other” because all you want to do is contribute and serve and share and give and make a difference. And that is so full-filling, that it puts you right back onto the other branch where you experience the Great Fullness of Life, where you’re one with God and there is no “other.”

And, so you see, you can live your whole life in the two branches of Gratitude…
