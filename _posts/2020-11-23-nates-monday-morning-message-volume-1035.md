## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,035**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! Well, Thanksgiving is upon us and let me be the first to wish you and your loved ones a very happy, healthy and safe celebration. As we navigate these unique times, I hope that you will find gratitude in even the smallest of ways, from a sparkling light that dances off your favorite crystal, to the pets under your feet while you roast the turkey, or from the laughs and voices that stream through the Zoom call with your family as you connect 2020-style. In every diversity we can find something to be grateful for, grace, compassion, strength and above all, love. From my family and team to yours, Happy Thanksgiving\! Let’s make it a great week\!
