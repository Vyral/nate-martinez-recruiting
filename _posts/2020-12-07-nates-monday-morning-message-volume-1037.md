**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

The Christmas Tree Angel from Michigan

When Michigan resident Chad Rose just happened to have an extra Christmas tree that was used on his business’s parade float, he did what any decent person would do: he posted on Craigslist to give it away for free. For some, a tree is an annual necessity and integral part of the holidays, but for many it’s an expense that needs to be saved for daily essentials. After posting the ad, his inbox was immediately flooded with touching stories of why various families deserved to have the tree.

With each e-mail he read, it became clear how significant a simple tree can be in contributing to the holiday aura. One email, which he shared with&nbsp;[MLive.com](http://www.mlive.com/living/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2013/12/tom_rademacher_good_samaritan.html){: target="_blank"}, read,&nbsp;*“Having a real Christmas tree would be such a great blessing this year \[because\] usually we draw a Christmas tree on a large poster and hang it in the corner.”*&nbsp;Realizing that $25 towards a tree was too much for some families to spare, Chad went out and bought 40 more to give away for free. He spent most of the next day going over his list of emails, checking it twice, and not paying much attention to who’s been naughty or nice – just deserving.

But the good holiday spirit in this story doesn’t stop there — Ann Posont of East Grand Rapids read Rose’s Ad and contacted him, not to get, but to give. She offered to donate ornaments and other trimming for the 40 trees he had picked up.

“Going out to gather up more trees after realizing the impact it would have on those in need is just so generous,” she said. “It tells a lot about his character, and makes you want to help.”
