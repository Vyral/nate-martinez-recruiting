## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,038**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! I want to thank each of you who came out Saturday or donated online to support the food drive we hosted with our partners at Motto Mortgage. The food banks always need our help, however this year there is an extra need. So, a big thank you\!\!\!

I wanted to share a thought I had the other day in today’s message. Each of us are unique, in fact so unique that not one person has the same DNA, thumb print or strand of hair. Each person has a unique set of gifts and abilities that leave an imprint on the world around us; the light you shine makes a difference. To be alive on planet earth today, is truly a miracle. However, the time we have is limited which makes each day a precious gift that shouldn’t be wasted. The world needs your light. Let it shine. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

The Story of Two Wolves

An old Cherokee is teaching his grandson about life. “A fight is going on inside me,” he said to the boy. “It is a terrible fight, and it is between two wolves. One is evil – he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority and ego.”

He continued, “The other is good – he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. The same fight tis going on inside you – and inside every other person, too.”

The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather, “Which wolf will win?”

The old Cherokee simply replied, “The one you feed.”

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“You are on a soulful path that asks you to step into the greatest version of yourself. It is a sacred gift to shine your brightest light, not just in your moments of glory, but each day.” – Debbie Ford

“The secret to happiness is freedom...And the secret to freedom is courage.” – Thucydides

“I will not follow where the path may lead, but I will go where there is no path, and I will leave a trail.” - Muriel Strode
