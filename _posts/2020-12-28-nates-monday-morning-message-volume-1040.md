## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,040**

&nbsp;

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! I hope that each of you reading this email had a lovely holiday weekend however you chose to spend it\! There are only a few days left in 2020 and I want to be the first to wish you a happy New Year. While we have no way to predict what the next twelve months has in store for us, we can choose to focus on what is most important: our family, our faith and our health. I will be celebrating the New Year with a deep gratitude for each agent who chooses RE/MAX Professionals as their brokerage and the many families we were able to serve this year with their real estate needs. I am truly a blessed man to be surrounded by so many amazing people, my loving family and my real estate crew both on my team and those who help me run the brokerage. From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU, and Happy New Year\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Auld Lang Syne

Should auld acquaintance be forgot,<br>And never brought to mind?<br>Should auld acquaintance be forgot,

And auld lang syne.<br>For auld lang syne, my jo,<br>For auld lang syne.<br>We’ll tak a cup o’ kindness yet,<br>For auld lang syne.

“Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year.” – Ralph Waldo Emerson
