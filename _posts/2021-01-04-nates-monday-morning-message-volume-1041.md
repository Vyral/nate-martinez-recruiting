## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,041**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! I will admit this past week has been somewhat unproductive, and while the yummy holiday food and sweets were a welcomed delight, especially this year, I found myself overindulging. On top of the fact, I haven’t felt a hundred percent, which led my mind to think the worst – could it be Covid-19? Its funny how the mind can go straight to the worst-case scenario\! I am not trying to make any excuses; however, my family has been directly impacted by the virus as someone I love dearly has been in and out of the hospital over the holiday with Covid and pneumonia. Anxiety + worry + overindulging = not a good mental place.

This week has been a reminder how important good health really is – and that is why I am committing to the 75 Hard Program starting today. I want to get my mind set strong so I can focus on both health and business. I would like to invite you to join me on a journey that changes your habits and your life – if you don’t know what the 75 Hard Program is, you can Google it (\#75Hard), or give me a call. Let’s get healthy both physically and mentally together – and make it a great week\! &nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

You may think that you are completely insignificant in this world. But someone drinks coffee from their favorite cup that you gave them. Someone heard a song on the radio that reminded them of you. Someone read a book that you recommended and plunged headfirst into it. Someone smiled after a hard day of work because they remembered the joke that you told them today. Someone loves themselves a little bit more because you gave them a compliment. Never think that you have no influence whatsoever. Your touch, word, and good deed which you leave behind, can not be erased.
