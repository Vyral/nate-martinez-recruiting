## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,042**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! Today I want to take a moment to thank each person who donated to the food drive we co-hosted with Motto Mortgage to support our local St. Mary’s Food Bank. As we all know, the food banks have been taxed this year with the pandemic and we are so grateful to have contributed 4,628 meals last week. There was 1,521 pounds of food donated and cash that will feed our neighbors in need. They say it takes a village – and we are blessed to be among so many gracious and generous people. THANK YOU\!

When we give, we do more than the actual giving of money or the can of beans from our pantry – we make a difference. This week I’d like to encourage you to look for a way you can make a difference, even if it’s as simple as a can of beans or a kind gesture to a strange. Let’s make a difference together – and make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

The 5 Minute Rule

When you are about to abandon a task because you’ve had enough or feel you aren’t getting anywhere or are just bored then try applying the “5 Minute Rule.” Say to yourself I will stick at it for just 5 minutes more and then I can give up or take a break.

At the worst you get 5 minutes work done and at the best you will have found a second wind, got focused and become productive. Of course, what you are aiming for is to move into The Zone when suddenly work becomes effortless, the words just flow, the paperwork gets dealt with, you make that call you’ve been dreading, nothing seems a problem. But imagine if you hadn’t applied the five-minute trick you might have never got there you might have gone and switched the television on and watched a replay of the ballgame\!

You can use the 5-minute-more trick in the Gym as well or when doing jobs in the house. I actually hear my lazy inner self thinking up excellent reasons why I should abandon my endeavor, you’ve had a long day, mustn’t tire myself out for tomorrow, it’s too cold or hot or windy and the craftiest one shouldn’t you be doing another task altogether.

Remember the other 5-minute rule that we often want to give up a task after just 5 minutes, 5 minutes into writing an essay or starting a run that’s the danger time before we’ve warmed to the task before we see any progress, you can use the five-minute rule to help you through this discouraging phase.

Go on, do five minutes more…
