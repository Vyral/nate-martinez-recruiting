## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,043**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! We are halfway through the first month of the New Year – how is it going so far? Today I want to write about time and more importantly time management – for years we have focused on managing time, to only realize that we can’t actually manage time. Every day the sun comes up and goes down leaving us with a mere twenty-four hours in the day to live a life on purpose. What can we do instead to be effective with our limited hours in each day? We can focus our efforts on how and what we are doing, who we are spending it with and what we say yes or no to.

This week I’d like to challenge you to be aware of what you are doing with your day – perhaps limit the amount of time you spend on social media, and instead go for a walk with your family. Maybe skip the news for a couple days and pick up a book you’ve been meaning to read. Or perhaps its time to hire the housekeeper you have been wanting so you don’t have to spend your only days off cleaning the house. Challenge every minutes of your day to ensure you are spending it wisely on things that help you life your life on purpose. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

That One Time by Rick Baldwin

If I could slice a still instant out of moving life,

I would carve an ample piece of that one time,

And place it under a crystal dome

Gazing daily at its deliciousness until temptation finally breaks me,

And I bust it from its detention,

Devouring it like a brown bear at a honey tree.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Yesterday's the past, tomorrow's the future, but today is a gift. That's why it's called the present.” - Bil Keane

“Time and tide wait for no man.” - Geoffrey Chaucer

“Time is the coin of your life. It is the only coin you have, and only you can determine how it will be spent. Be careful lest you let other people spend it for you.” - Carl Sandburg
