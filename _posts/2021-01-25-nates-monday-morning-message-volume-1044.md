## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,044**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! I listened to a financial speaker last week while attending a virtual real estate conference, which has inspired the topic for today’s message. Opportunity. He was sharing his thoughts and expert opinion on the impact the pandemic is having on real estate, investing, commercial, retail, restaurants, travel, etc. His presentation caused a mix of emotions, ranging from depression to excitement as Covid-19 has done a lot more damage than many of us truly understand, myself included. However, the key point to his talk was opportunity – and more importunately, will you be ready if opportunity shows up at your front door? We tend to focus on the hurdles we face but we don’t look at them as hidden opportunities. As we continue to navigate the pandemic, I would like to challenge you to look for the opportunity – in whatever form it applies to your life, your career, your future. In every dark cloud, there is a silver lining. Can you find it? Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

There once was a very wealthy and curious king. This king had a huge boulder placed in the middle of a road. Then he hid nearby to see if anyone would try to remove the gigantic rock from the road.

The first people to pass by were some of the king’s wealthiest merchants and courtiers. Rather than moving it, they simply walked around it. A few loudly blamed the King for not maintaining the roads. Not one of them tried to move the boulder.

Finally, a peasant came along. His arms were full of vegetables. When he got near the boulder, rather than simply walking around it as the others had, the peasant put down his load and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. It took a lot of effort, but he finally succeeded.

The peasant gathered up his load and was ready to go on his way when he saw a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The peasant opened the purse. The purse was stuffed full of gold coins and a note from the king. The king’s note said the purse’s gold was a reward for moving the boulder from the road.

The king showed the peasant what many of us never understand: every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.” - Milton Berle

“You never let a serious crisis go to waste. And what I mean by that it's an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.” - Rahm Emanuel

“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.” – Thomas A. Edison
