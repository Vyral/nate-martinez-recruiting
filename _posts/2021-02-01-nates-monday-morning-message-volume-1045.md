## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,045**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you well and sticking to your New Year’s resolutions as we start a new month in 2021. It is about now that we’ve either succeed with sticking with our resolutions or completely given up. If you find yourself in the later, I would like to encourage you to revisit your resolutions – are they in alignment with who you are and are you clear about why you want to do them? And then I’d like to challenge you to re-commit. You do not have to wait for next January to start again. Today is a new day in a new month – you can do it. I believe in you\! Let’s make it a great week\!

PS today is also the start to Black History Month, which was established by President Gerald Ford in 1976. The president called upon us to seize the opportunity to honor and recognize the accomplishments of our fellow black Americans throughout history. I’d like to ask you to think about how you can contribute this month.

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

I will tell you a story of my friend Monty Roberts.

As he was a kid, his father as a horse trainer was moving from stable to stable, from ranch to ranch, training horses. Thus, the boy‘s school career was constantly interrupted. One day, when he was a senior, teacher asked him to write about what he wanted to be when he grew up. He did not hesitate a minute and wrote seven-page paper about his aim to be an owner of a horse ranch, he wrote many details and drew a location of buildings and stables and even a detailed house plan.

Two days later he received his paper back with letter F on the front page. After class he came to teacher and asked, “Why did I receive an F?“ The teacher responded, “This dreams is so unrealistic for a boy like you, who has no money, no resources and who comes from itinerant family. There is no possibility that you will reach your great goals one day.” Then the teacher offered to rewrite the paper with more realistic attitude.

The boy went home and asked his father, how he should act. The father answered: “This decision is very important for you. So you have to make your own mind on this.”

After several days the boy brought the same paper to his teacher. No changes were made. He said, “Keep the F and I will keep my dream.”

Now Monty Roberts owns 4,000-square-foot house in the middle of 200-acre horse ranch and he still has that school paper, which now is framed over the fireplace.

Remember, you have to follow your heart, never give up, move on with determination and persistence, and never let anyone take your dreams away.
