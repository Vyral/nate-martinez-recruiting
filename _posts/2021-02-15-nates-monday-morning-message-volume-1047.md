## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,047**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! Happy President’s Day to each of you reading this email today\! What a great day we are celebrating that is packed with history, tradition, and the sound of freedom – dating back to 1799. After the death of America’s first president, George Washington, his supporters began recognizing his birthday on February 22nd. His birthday became a federal holiday in the District of Columbia in 1879 and rest of the US in 1885. Fast forward a few years to 1971 when president Nixon issued an executive order that the third Monday in February would be recognized as President’s Day. While I know most of us enjoy the long weekend, I would like to encourage you to take a moment to reflect on the history of our great country and remember those who came before us so we can call ourselves Americans. Let’s make it a great day and a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

America the Beautiful by Katharine Lee Bates, 1893

O beautiful for spacious skies,<br>For amber waves of grain,<br>For purple mountain majesties<br>Above the fruited plain\!

America\! America\!<br>God shed His grace on thee,<br>And crown thy good with brotherhood<br>From sea to shining sea\!

O beautiful for pilgrim feet<br>Whose stern impassion'd stress<br>A thoroughfare for freedom beat<br>Across the wilderness

America\! America\!<br>God mend thine ev'ry flaw,<br>Confirm thy soul in self-control,<br>Thy liberty in law.

O beautiful for heroes prov'd<br>In liberating strife,<br>Who more than self their country lov'd,<br>And mercy more than life.

America\! America\!<br>May God thy gold refine<br>Till all success be nobleness,<br>And ev'ry gain divine.

O beautiful for patriot dream<br>That sees beyond the years<br>Thine alabaster cities gleam<br>Undimmed by human tears.

America\! America\!<br>God shed His grace on thee,<br>And crown thy good with brotherhood<br>From sea to shining sea.
