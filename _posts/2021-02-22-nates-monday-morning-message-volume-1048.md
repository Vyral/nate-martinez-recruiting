## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,048**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! Today I want to talk about gratitude…and more specifically the gratitude I have for the thousands of clients we have had the pleasure of serving for thirty-five years in the Valley of the Sun. Gratitude for the more than 1,000 agents who have come through the doors at RE/MAX Professionals…some have stayed, others have moved on to a different brokerage or opened their own brick and mortar.

When I started out back in 1986 my goal was to supplement my income from the concrete labor job I was working at the time so I could take my family on a vacation to Disneyland and buy a big screen television. Little did I know the incredible opportunity that I was creating for myself, my family, my future team, and the impact my decision would have on countless lives that I have met over the year, helped buy or sell a home or mentored and coached to become a great real estate agent. When I think about it, I am overwhelmed by the amount of gratitude I have for those who trusted me, saw my vision and fearlessly followed me into unchartered waters. Today, this message is dedicated to each of you. And with the sincerest gratitude, I say THANK YOU. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

One day King came to his garden and saw withering and dying trees, bushes, and flowers.

An oak said it dies because it can’t be as high as a pine.

A pine tree was falling down because it could not give grapes like a grapevine.

Meanwhile the grapevine was dying because it couldn’t blossom like a rose.

But soon the King found a single plant, pleasing heart, bloomy and fresh.

The king asked: “All the trees and flowers here are withering, and you are flourishing, why?”

“I think it comes naturally. You have planted me, because it was your wish and your choice. If you would like to grow an oak, grapes or rose, you would plant them. And I cannot be anything else than what I am. So, I try to develop my best qualities.”

Moral of the story: Look at yourself. You can be only yourself. It is impossible for you to become someone else. You can enjoy life and blossom, or you can wither if you do not accept yourself.
