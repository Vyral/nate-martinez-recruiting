## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,049**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you well and refreshed for a new week\! Today I want to talk about fear – did you know that fear is the root to perfectionism, control and squashes more dreams than other emotion we experience? I want to empower you with a tool that has helped me over the years in regard to facing fear – the feeling of fear is the same emotion felt in the physical body as excitement – it all boils down to how we label what we are feeling\! There is nothing perfect in life, and the only thing we can control is how we respond to what we are feeling. This week, I want to challenge you to start with plan A but be prepared for plan W – W for the win\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

There once was this criminal who had committed a crime

(Because, hey, that’s what criminals do. That’s their job\!)

Anyway, he was sent to the king for his punishment.

The king told him he had a choice of two punishments.

He could be hung by a rope.

Or take what’s behind the big, dark, scary, mysterious iron door.

The criminal quickly decided on the rope.

As the noose was being slipped on him, he turned to the king and asked:

“By the way, out of curiosity, what’s behind that door?”

The king laughed and said:

“You know, it’s funny, I offer everyone the same choice, and nearly everyone picks the rope.”

“So,” said the criminal, “Tell me. What’s behind the door? I mean, obviously, I won’t tell anyone,” he said, pointing to the noose around his neck.

The king paused then answered:

“Freedom, but it seems most people are so afraid of the unknown that they immediately take the rope.”
