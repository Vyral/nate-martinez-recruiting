## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,050**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! Recently I was listening to an interview with Matthew McConaughey as he was talking about his recently published book, [Greenlights](https://www.amazon.com/Greenlights-Matthew-McConaughey/dp/0593139135). He quoted a phrase that I have heard before but this time it struck me in a different way – “good is the enemy of great.” Read that again and let it sit in your gut for a minute – “good is the enemy of great.” How many times have you found yourself taking short cuts or giving up because it got harder than you expected? How much potential are you leaving on the table because “its good enough?” This week I’d like to challenge you ask yourself do I want to be good or do I want to be great? And fill in the blanks on whatever it is that you want to do in your life – learn to cook, spend more time with your kids, start a side hustle online selling your crafts – it doesn’t matter. What matters is what sets your soul on fire and drives you to be the best human being you can be. You can do it. I believe in you. Let’s make it a great week\!

PS if you haven’t read or listened to the book [Greenlights](https://www.amazon.com/Greenlights-Matthew-McConaughey/dp/0593139135), I would highly recommend it\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Let Go by Dr. Billy Graham

A little child was playing one day with a very valuable vase. He put his hand into it and could not withdraw it. His father too, tried his best, but all in vain. They were thinking of breaking the vase when the father said, "Now, my son, make one more try. Open your hand and hold your fingers out straight as you see me doing, and then pull."

To their astonishment the little fellow said, "O no, father. I couldn't put my fingers out like that, because if I did, I would drop my penny."

Smile, if you will--but thousands of us are like that little boy, so busy holding on to the world's worthless penny that we cannot accept liberation. I beg you to drop the trifle in your heart. Surrender\! Let Go\!
