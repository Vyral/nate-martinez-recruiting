## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,051**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! In honor of St. Patrick’s Day, I thought I would write about luck in today’s message. Do you believe in luck? Have you experienced luck? Is there such a thing as luck in the rea world?

By definition, luck is success or failure brought on by chance rather than your action. Sounds almost mystical\! However, I believe that to be “lucky” we have to have vision, determination, and hustle. Or in other words, you have to make your own luck in order to be “lucky.” I’d like to challenge you to channel your inner-Leprechaun and create a week full of grit and hustle that leads to wins and victories that others might call luck\! Let’s make it a great week\!

In Celtic folktales
