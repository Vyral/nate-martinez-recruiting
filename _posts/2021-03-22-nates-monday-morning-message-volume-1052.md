## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,052**

Welcome to the first day of spring, and this edition of the Monday Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you well and refreshed for a new week. It is officially spring and that means the desert is alive with vibrant colors; it truly is an amazing time of year to be in Arizona\!

Spring is significant as it symbolizes new beginnings – fresh buds begin to bloom, animals awaken, and the earth seems to come to life again with the return of the sun. This is a new week – and just like spring, there are new beginnings for each of us. Let’s make it count and make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Lines Written in Early Spring, **By William Wordworth**

I heard a thousand blended notes,<br>While in a grove I sate reclined,<br>In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts<br>Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link<br>The human soul that through me ran;<br>And much it grieved my heart to think<br>What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,<br>The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;<br>And ’tis my faith that every flower<br>Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,<br>Their thoughts I cannot measure:<br>—But the least motion which they made<br>It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,<br>To catch the breezy air;<br>And I must think, do all I can,<br>That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,<br>If such be Nature’s holy plan,<br>Have I not reason to lament<br>What man has made of man?

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“No winter lasts forever; no spring skips its turn.” - Hal Borland

“We cannot stop the winter or the summer from coming. We cannot stop the spring or the fall or make them other than they are. They are gifts from the universe that we cannot refuse. But we can choose what we will contribute to life when each arrives.” - Gary Zukav

“The beautiful spring came; and when Nature resumes her loveliness, the human soul is apt to revive also.” - Harriet Ann Jacobs
