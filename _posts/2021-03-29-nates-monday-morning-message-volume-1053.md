## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,053**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you rested and ready for a new week full of new opportunities to live our best lives\! This week many of us will prepare to gather for the Easter holiday coming on Sunday, April 4th. With many Arizonian’s getting vaccinated, life is beginning to return to a “new normal” and it is perfect timing as we embrace spring and the renewal of life (both metaphorically and physically). From my team and my family, let me be the first to wish you a happy Easter\! However, you are planning to recognize the holiday, please be healthy, safe and joyous. Let’s make it a great week\!
