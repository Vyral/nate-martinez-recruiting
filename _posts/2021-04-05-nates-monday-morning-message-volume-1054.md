## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,054**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message\! I hope you had a relaxing and rewarding holiday weekend and that you are ready to face this new week with a refreshed and renewed spirit. Tonya and I enjoyed a wonderful afternoon with our children and grandchildren, which is my inspiration for today’s message – family. Whether it is blended, extended, by blood or adopted, family is the root to everything in life. It is our motivation to get out of bed each morning, the drive behind our goals and aspirations, the reason we smile when we think of days gone by. However, family can also be the first to get neglected because we take for granted that they will always be family. This year was the first year without my beloved mother on one of her favorite holidays. Even though she was 93, and lived a happy long life, it feels like it wasn’t long enough, especially as we navigate life without her on holidays that we would have spent together. This week, I want to challenge you to call your parents, hug your babies just a little longer and offer that “I am sorry” conversation with whoever needs to hear it. Life is precious. Let’s make every second count – and make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

A man walked into a small Irish pub and ordered three beers. Bartender was surprised, but he served that man three beers. One hour later the man ordered three beers again. The very next day that man ordered three beers again and drank quietly at a table. This repeated several times and shortly after the people of the town were whispering about the man, who was ordering three beers at once.

A couple of weeks later, the bartender decided to clear this out and inquired: “I do not want to pry, but could you explain, why do you order three beers all the time?” The man replied: “It seems strange, isn‘t it? You see, my two brothers live abroad at the moment, one – in France and another – in Italy. We have made an agreement, that every time we go to pub each of us will order extra two beers and it will help keeping up the family bond.”

Soon all the town have heard about the man‘s answer and liked it a lot. The man became a local celebrity. Residents of the town were telling this story to newcomers or tourists and even invited them to that pub to look at Three Beer Man.

However, one day the man came to pub and ordered only two beers, not three as usual. The bartender served him with bad feeling. All that evening the man ordered and drank only two beers. The very next day all the town was talking about these news, some people pray for the soul of one of the brothers, others quietly grieve.

When the man came to pub the next time and ordered two beers again, the bartender asked him: “I would like to offer condolences to you, due to the death of your dear brother.” The man considered this for a moment and then replied: “Oh, you are probably surprised that I order only two beers now? Well, my two brothers are alive and well. It‘s just because of my decision. I promised myself to give up drinking.”
