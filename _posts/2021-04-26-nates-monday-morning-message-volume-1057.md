**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Everyone around the world knows Starbucks. It is one of the most recognizable symbols next to Mcdonalds and Superman. But it didn’t start that easy, without perseverance the coffee giant would never have existed.

Howard Schultz, the founder of Starbucks went to over 200 banks looking for his original loan. 242\!

Not only was he desperately trying to secure a loan, his wife was pregnant with their first child. After a year of rejections, he was able to secure the $400,000 needed from a doctor and two other individual investors.

Today, the brand employs over 137,000 people around the world.

Starbucks Stats ([via Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/15-facts-about-starbucks-that-will-blow-your-mind-2011-3#starbucks-has-added-an-average-of-two-stores-on-a-daily-basis-since-1987-1){: target="_blank"}):

*16,850 Starbucks locations in 40 countries*

*As of 2010, Starbucks employed 137,000 people — twice the population of Greenland*

*Starbucks adds two new stores on a daily basis since 1987*

And did I mention that Howard Schultz is worth nearly 3 billion dollars?

Perseverance Lesson: Never give up, no matter how hard it might seem. If Howard had not persevered the world wouldn’t know one of the most iconic brands ever.
