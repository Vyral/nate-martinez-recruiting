## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,058**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message…today I would like to invite you to join me on Thursday for a very special virtual event that we are hosting at RE/MAX Professionals with global keynote speaker, Nick Santonastasso. He is a medical miracle and inspiration\! Nick was born with a rare genetic condition, Hanhart Syndrome. Despite missing both his legs and one arm since birth, Nick went on to become an inspirational keynote speaker, internationally known bodybuilder and ﬁtness model.

Through his remarkable personal story, Nick shares how to realign your focus on what you have and what you can control instead of what you’re lacking. You can create a new empowering story where you’re the hero instead of the victim and, as a result, have better relationships, improve your finances, and become a better leader.

Nick has delivered his message to millions of people, and I am inviting you to join us to hear his empowering message this Thursday at 9am PST online. You can join us live streaming on Facebook or YouTube.
