## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,059**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope that this email finds you well and having spent a lovely weekend celebrating the special moms and moms-to-be in your life. I know I am a day late, however I would like to dedicate this week’s message to Tonya, my daughter Brandi, my daughter-in-law Ashley, and of course my beloved mother who is no longer with us.

To be a mother is so much more than giving birth; it is an endless responsibility with countless hours of nurturing and worrying. Every day I get to witness my amazing daughter Brandi do an outstanding job of raising my granddaughter – solo – and Hayden is becoming a beautiful young lady right before our eyes\! Every day I get to experience Tonya’s patience and steadiness, as we raise our fiercely determined daughter, Mila. She is the perfect blend of both T and I and it is so incredible to watch her develop into the spirit that she is becoming.

Last summer we were gifted with the first grandson and the next to carry the Martinez name into the future – little Nate Martinez, III. Ashley is a wonderful, caring and loving mother to both her sons and Tyler is the bonus grandson we never expected to have in our lives\! And of course, to my own mother who is no longer with us – it all started with her and I am beyond grateful for this life I get to live because of her. To each of you reading this and the moms in your life – don’t let the celebration just be one day of the year; let’s celebrate them every day. Happy Mother’s Day\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

I can’t repay the lessons<br>That you taught when I was small,<br>Or give you gift for gift,<br>The daily treasures I recall;<br>I can’t return encouragement<br>Or loving words of praise<br>In quite the way you did for me<br>Through all my childhood days.<br>But there’s one gift that I can give:<br>It’s all the love you’ve earned -<br>For love is what you always taught,<br>And love is what I learned.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Sometimes the strength of motherhood is greater than natural laws.” - Barbara Kingsolver

“My mother is a walking miracle.” - Leonardo DiCaprio

“I remember my mother's prayers and they have always followed me. They have clung to me all my life.” – Abraham Lincoln
