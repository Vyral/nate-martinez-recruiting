## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,060**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! Today I want to talk about teamwork. When I decided to start a real estate team many years ago, it was so we could help more people buy or sell a home and be the number one team in the Valley of the Sun. Little did I realize the impact that decision would have on my life and those who joined my team. In the beginning of my career, I thought I could do it all but realized over the years that with the help of others, the sky was the limit. I just had to ask and amazingly people who cared about me, who saw my passion and vision showed up to answer the call. This week I’d like to challenge you to think about where in your life that you could ask for help – and how does that support change your life and your goals? If you are the person who “does it all” for everyone in your life – I’d like to challenge you to get uncomfortable for a moment. The folks in your life want to give back and by always being the one to do it all, you are robbing them of the joy that they would experience if they had a chance to do something for you. &nbsp;If you need or want help, ask – I promise someone will show up and if they don’t, call me and I’ll be there. Let’s make it a great week\!
