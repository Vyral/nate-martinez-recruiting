## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,061**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! Last week I challenged each of you to ask for help in some area of your life – did you do it? What was the outcome? I’d love to hear your experience. This week let’s talk about feedback. As some of you know, I am in the middle of editing my first book with my co-author and longtime friend and colleague, Sarah Michelle Bliss and in the process, we have had to ask for feedback from various sources. Feedback can be tricky, especially when it is something we are unsure of, or maybe something we really love and are afraid people won’t love it the way we do. Feedback is vulnerability at its core. But without feedback, how do we measure our progress? How do we improve? How do we become best in class? This week, I’d like to challenge you to ask for feedback from someone you trust. Challenge yourself to be vulnerable so you can level up your game and live your best life. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

**The Elephant Rope**

As a man was passing the elephants, he suddenly stopped, confused by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg. No chains, no cages. It was obvious that the elephants could, at anytime, break away from their bonds but for some reason, they did not.

He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away. “Well,” trainer said, “when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.”

The man was amazed. These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they couldn’t, they were stuck right where they were.

Like the elephants, how many of us go through life hanging onto a belief that we cannot do something, simply because we failed at it once before?

Failure is part of learning; we should never give up the struggle in life.
