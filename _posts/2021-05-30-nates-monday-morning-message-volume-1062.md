## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,062**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! Today I want to honor and recognize the countless men and women who have sacrificed their lives to defend our freedoms. Today is not just about the extra day off or the BBQ party you might be hosting. Today is a day to remember. Today is a day to reflect. Today is a day to be in a deep state of gratitude for this great country we live in. From my family to yours, happy Memorial Day and thank you to those who gave it all, so we could have it all. Happy Memorial Day. Let’s make it a great week\!
