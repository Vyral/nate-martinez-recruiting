**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

LIFE IS written by Mother Theresa&nbsp;

Life is an opportunity, benefit from it.&nbsp;<br>Life is beauty, admire it.&nbsp;<br>Life is a dream, realize it.&nbsp;<br>Life is a challenge, meet it.&nbsp;<br>Life is a duty, complete it.&nbsp;<br>Life is a game, play it.&nbsp;<br>Life is a promise, fulfill it.&nbsp;<br>Life is sorrow, overcome it.&nbsp;<br>Life is a song, sing it.&nbsp;<br>Life is a struggle, accept it.&nbsp;<br>Life is a tragedy, confront it.&nbsp;<br>Life is an adventure, dare it.&nbsp;<br>Life is luck, make it.&nbsp;<br>Life is too precious, do not destroy it.&nbsp;<br>Life is life, fight for it.&nbsp;
