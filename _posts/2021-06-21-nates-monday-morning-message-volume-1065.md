## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,065**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope that each of you reading this had a lovely Father’s Day weekend and you were able to celebrate the special Dads in your life. For me, this day has taken on a new meaning after my son, Nate Jr. became a father last summer and now watching him develop into an amazing dad is an experience I just can’t describe with words. This week, I’d like to encourage you to keep the recognition going – Happy Father’s Day\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

**Anecdote for Fathers:** **A Poem by William Wordsworth**

I have a boy of five years old;<br>His face is fair and fresh to see;<br>His limbs are cast in beauty’s mold<br>And dearly he loves me.

One morn we strolled on our dry walk,<br>Or quiet home all full in view,<br>And held such intermitted talk<br>As we are wont to do.

My thoughts on former pleasures ran;<br>I thought of Kilve’s delightful shore,<br>Our pleasant home when spring began,<br>A long, long year before.

A day it was when I could bear<br>Some fond regrets to entertain;<br>With so much happiness to spare,<br>I could not feel a pain.

The green earth echoed to the feet<br>Of lambs that bounded through the glade,<br>From shade to sunshine, and as fleet<br>From sunshine back to shade.

Birds warbled round me – and each trace<br>Of inward sadness had its charm;<br>Kilve, thought I, was a favoured place,<br>And so is Liswyn farm.

My boy beside me tripped, so slim<br>And graceful in his rustic dress\!<br>And, as we talked, I questioned him,<br>In very idleness.

‘Now tell me, had you rather be,’<br>I said, and took him by the arm,‘<br>On Kilve’s smooth shore, by the green sea,<br>Or here at Liswyn farm?’

In careless mood he looked at me,<br>While still I held him by the arm,<br>And said, ‘At Kilve I’d rather be<br>Than here at Liswyn farm.’

‘Now, little Edward, say why so:<br>My little Edward, tell me why.’ –<br>‘I cannot tell, I do not know.’ –<br>‘Why, this is strange,’ said I;

‘For, here are woods, hills smooth and warm:<br>There surely must one reason be<br>Why you would change sweet Liswyn farm<br>For Kilve by the green sea.’

At this, my boy hung down his head,<br>He blushed with shame, nor made reply;<br>And three times to the child I said,<br>‘Why, Edward, tell me why?’

His head he raised – there was in sight,<br>It caught his eye, he saw it plain –<br>Upon the house-top, glittering bright,<br>A broad and gilded vane.

Then did the boy his tongue unlock,<br>And eased his mind with this reply:<br>‘At Kilve there was no weather-cock;<br>And that’s the reason why.’

O dearest, dearest boy\! my heart<br>For better lore would seldom yearn,<br>Could I but teach the hundredth part<br>Of what from thee I learn.
