## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,067**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope that each of you reading this email had a lovely weekend and if you are appreciating a day off in observation of the holiday, I hope you are spending it doing something that brings you joy. Today’s message is about freedom, which is really what the fourth of July represents. Freedom to choose; freedom to be. Freedom to say; freedom to do. Freedom to be you – what a gift that we should never take for granted. What does freedom mean to you? Let’s make it a great week\!
