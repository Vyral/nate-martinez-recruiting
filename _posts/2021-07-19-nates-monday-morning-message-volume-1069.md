## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,069**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! This week I had the opportunity to hear Wayne Frederick speak at a RE/MAX event – I am blessed to be with an organization that believes in education and provides opportunities like these to learn and level up our game as real estate agents. While I took several pages of notes, there is one part of his presentation I’d like to share today. He talked about the three different types of time in life: play time, pay time and prep time.

The quality and quantity of your play time is directly linked to the quality and quantity of your pay time, and the quality and quantity of your pay time is directly linked to the quality and quantity of your prep time. Many of us get bogged down with the pay time, because of our inconsistency in prep time. But by preparing more appropriately, you can master the process and in turn, gain more confidence. This will lead to more action and consistency so you can actually enjoy your play time. This week, I’d like to challenge you to level up your prep time. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Here are 5 Essential Time Management Techniques:

1. Be intentional: keep a to-do list.
2. Be prioritized: rank your task by importance.
3. Be focused: manage your distractions.
4. Be structured: time block your day.
5. Be self-aware: track the time spent on task.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Time and tide wait for no man.” - Geoffrey Chaucer

“If you don't have time to do it right, when will you have time to do it over?” - John Wooden

“Time is the most valuable thing a man can spend.” - Theophrastus
