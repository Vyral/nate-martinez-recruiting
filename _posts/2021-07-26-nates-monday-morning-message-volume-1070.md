## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,070**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! This week, I’d like to share some exciting news with you\! Some of you may already know from conversations and social media, that I am about to launch my first published book with my long-time business partner and teammate, Sarah Michelle Bliss. It has been a labor of love over the last few years writing the book and we are so excited to open the chapters of our journey together in real estate with a goal that it will help agents across the globe.

8 Ways to Dominate Any Real Estate Market is our story of where we came from, how we got where we are today and the 8 steps it takes to dominate any market conditions. Sarah and I have weathered through many different markets in the last 25 years working together and the 8 steps are tried-and-true ways to not only survive but thrive\! In addition to writing one book, we took the 8 steps further and developed a companion – a 365-day journal which is everything a REALTOR&reg; needs to be tracking in order to have a successful career in real estate. This journal is a GAME-CHANGER, and we can’t wait to get it in the hands of agents in every market\!

Both books will be available on Amazon Tuesday, August 3rd – you can get your copy on our website, [www.8waystodominateanyrealestatemarket.com](http://www.8waystodominateanyrealestatemarket.com). If you are in the local Phoenix market, I’d like to invite you to our [in-person book signing](https://www.facebook.com/events/310379267454251?active_tab=about) on August 13th from 12-4:00pm at our office in Glendale.

Publishing a book is not something I would have told you was on my career bucket list, however, it has pushed me outside of my comfort zone into a world I never even knew I wanted to be a part of. So this week, while I am share this exciting news, I’d also like to encourage you to get our of your comfort zone and think about the possibilities that lie outside the realms of your current reality. Let’s make it a great week\!
