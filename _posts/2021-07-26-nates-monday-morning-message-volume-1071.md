## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,071**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! Today I want to talk about habits – I just started working in a brand-new journal that my long-time friend and business partner, Sarah Michelle Bliss and I designed as a result of writing our first book 8 Ways to Dominate Any Real Estate Market (which will be available tomorrow on Amazon). As I worked through the journal pages, I was reminded of the power of good habits, such as the habit of journaling every day. Good habits set us for success, they help to get clear on our intentions and how we can win the day – consistently.

If you want to take a peek at this brand new, nothing-like-it-on-the-market for REALTORS&reg;, I invite you check out our brand-new journal called Your Real Estate Journal to Abundance: 8 Steps (which will also be available this week on Amazon).&nbsp;

Remember, as the great Og Mandino said his book, *The Greatest Salesman in the World* – “In truth, the only difference between those who have failed and those who have succeeded lies in the difference of their habits. Good habits are the key to all success. Bad habits are the unlocked door to failure. Thus, the first law I will obey, which precedeth all others – I will form good habits and become their slave.” Let’s make it a great week\!
