**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

The Hunters Had Rented

Two hunters had rented an airplane to get to the distant forest zone. After couple of weeks the pilot returned to take them back. After looking at their hunting trophies he said “The plane won’t be able to carry more than one buffalo. You will have to leave one of them.”

“But last year the pilot agreed to take on board two buffalos the same size as these,” the hunters protested. The pilot thought about it and said, “Ok. If it worked the last year, it should work this time too.”

The plane tried to take off with two passengers and two buffalos on board, but it was not able to reach the required height. The plane crashed into the nearest hill. After getting out the plane wreck, the hunters looked around. One of them said to another, “Where do you think we are?”

His pal examined the surroundings and answered, “I think we are two miles south from the place that we crashed the last time.”
