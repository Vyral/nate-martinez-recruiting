## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,075**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you well and rested from the weekend. It’s a new day and a new week\! I’d like to thank everyone who donated an item for our live auction – and a big thank you to everyone who came out for the event on Friday. In just one hour, we were able to raise $10,300 for the Month of Miracles\! This money stays local and 100% goes to support our beloved Phoenix Children’s Hospital. We are so proud of the fundraising we have done over the past 20 years – and collectively we have donated more than $500,000\! We absolutely could not do this without the support of our clients, family, friends and the wonderful agents who are a part of RE/MAX Professionals. We set a goal of $25,000 this year – we still have a bit to go so if you feel inclined to help, we’d love your donation, no matter how big or small. Below is a link where you can donate online. Again, thank you – we appreciate the support and love for the kiddos. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

A few years ago, I was circling the block to find a parking space so I could get a cup of coffee. A woman walking by flagged me down and said she would go in and get me the coffee if I gave her my order. While she was inside, a spot opened up and I was waiting by my car when she exited. I thanked her when she came out and went to hand her money. She said the coffee was on her. She went on to explain that she had metastatic cancer and with the time she had left, she wanted to do as many good deeds as possible. I shared with her that I was a cancer survivor and the two of us ― complete strangers ― shared a hug and some tears. She asked me to pay it forward as often as possible, and ever since that day I make sure to do random acts of kindness for others as often as I can. ―Sara Marsi, Providence, Rhode Island
