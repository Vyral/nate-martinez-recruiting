Today I’m here with a special guest Sarah Michelle Bliss. We’ve been lucky to be friends and work together for the past 25 years, and a couple of years ago she came to me and said we needed to write a book. We’ve been working on it ever since and now we’ve had it published. It’s called *“8 Ways to Dominate Any Real Estate Market,”* and it became available on August 3.

The book goes over eight steps to help you weather any real estate market. Together, Sarah and I have experienced both the boom and crash of the market and everything in between. Our book encompasses the tried and true basics that, no matter what the market is doing, will help you succeed. **Whether you’re a new or seasoned agent, this book is designed to help you.&nbsp;**

What’s in our book is what we’ve tried and learned along the way. Some of these things you may have heard before, but we wrote it to help fellow real estate agents.

One thing we wrote about is the Top 50 Program. The top 50 are the people who know, like, and trust you, and if you engage with them enough, they’ll do business with you. More importantly, if they know another agent, these are the people who will do business with you, not them. The book provides a full-blown business plan to engage your top 50 and ensure you’re their top-of-mind person.&nbsp;

**Here in Phoenix, 90,000 licensed Realtors are running around**, so most people know someone in the business. One goal is to get a referral from each of those 50 people. Even if you only close half that number, that’s a pretty good year for most agents. Read the book; take action\!&nbsp;

Please join our Facebook group and simply search “8 Ways to Dominate Any Real Estate Market”. You can [visit our book’s website here](https://eightwaystodominateanyrealestatemarket.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and it’s also available for purchase on Amazon. Our book made the International Best-Seller List within 24 hours of launch\!&nbsp;

**In our next video, we’ll discuss the companion product we created to go along with our book.** If you have questions or we can help you in any way, just let us know via phone or email. We would love to help you.
