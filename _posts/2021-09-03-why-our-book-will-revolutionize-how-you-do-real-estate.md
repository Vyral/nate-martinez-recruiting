As some of you may know, Sarah Michelle Bliss and I recently wrote a book called *Your Real Estate Journey to Abundance in 8 Steps*. In this book, we wanted to revolutionize the way real estate is sold. There is nothing on the market that resembles what we’ve done with this book, and **that’s because this book is specifically targeted at real estate agents.&nbsp;**

**This book is really a workbook.** You can track your progress and what you’re doing with your day, so the book will hold you accountable for doing the work it recommends. Whether it’s following up with clients, closing homes, or even eating right, this book will get you in the right mindset for success.&nbsp;

Think about it. **If you start your day with three things you want to do and three people you want to talk to, it sets you up for a win**. You will begin to start acting with intention rather than mindlessly trying to generate leads.
