## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,076**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you well and enjoying the long holiday weekend. Today, I wanted to remind everyone that while the cookouts and cold beers are a great way to spend the holiday, Labor Day was formed as a day to pay tribute to the contributions and achievements of the American workers in the late 1800s.

At the height of the Industrial Revolution in the US, the average American worked 12-hours a day, seven days a week just to barely make ends meet. Children as young as five or six were put to work in mills, factories, and mines for cheap labor. People of all ages, but mostly the very poor or recent immigrants faced dangerously unsafe working conditions, without access to fresh air, sanitary facilities or breaks during their shifts. The rights and protections we have today, did not come without a fight – and there were many American workers who sacrificed their own lives in demand for change.

So, on this Labor Day, I’d like to encourage you and your family to take a moment to pay respect to those hard working, dedicated people who paved the way for the America we know today. Happy Labor Day\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Labor Day Fun Facts

The first United States Labor Day was celebrated on September 5, 1882, in New York City. It was planned by the Central Labor Union with a parade of about 10,000 workers who took unpaid leave to have a parade.

The worker’s holiday not only marks the end of summer, but it supposedly marks the end of hot dog season too. According to the National Hot Dog & Sausage Council, hot dog season starts on Memorial Day and ends on Labor Day, coinciding with the end of baseball season.

No white after Labor Day? Because Labor Day traditionally marked the end of summer, people weren’t supposed to wear white after the holiday. Back in the day rich folk would stow away their white clothes after summer as a leisure fashion statement.&nbsp;

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Each year, Labor Day gives us an opportunity to recognize the invaluable contributions that working men and women make to our nation, our economy and our collective prosperity. It gives us a chance to show gratitude for workers' grit, dedication, ingenuity and strength, which define our nation's character.” - Tom Perez

“Labor Day is a time to recognize and reflect on that work, and for elected officials to recommit to the too-often ignored task of fighting to improve the lives of working families.” - Elissa Slotkin

“As we celebrate Labor Day, we honor the men and women who fought tirelessly for workers' rights, which are so critical to our strong and successful labor force.” – Elizabeth Esty
