## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,077**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you well, rested and ready for a new week. On Saturday, all of America paused to reflect a day that rocked our country twenty years ago…it was also the very first day that RE/MAX Professionals opened its doors. As we celebrated a new chapter in our lives, the world was shocked and heartbroken. I want to dedicate today’s message to the nearly 3,000 people who lost their lives on 9/11…may we never forget. To the handful of agents who took the leap of faith with Frank and me, thank you for your trust and confidence as we forged forward into a territory unknown. And lastly, to the 1,000 folks who have been a part of our company over the past 20 years, thank you. We would not be here today if its wasn’t for each and everyone of you. September 11 comes every year and while it was a milestone anniversary this weekend, may we remember every single day that freedom isn’t free…united we stand as the greatest country in the world. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

God Bless the U.S.A. by Lee Greenwood

If tomorrow all the things were gone<br>I worked for all my life<br>And I had to start again<br>With just my children and my wife<br>I'd thank my lucky stars<br>To be livin' here today<br>'Cause the flag still stands for freedom<br>And they can't take that away

And I'm proud to be an American<br>Where at least I know I'm free<br>And I won't forget the men who died<br>Who gave that right to me<br>And I'd gladly stand up<br>Next to you and defend her still today<br>'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land<br>God bless the USA

From the lakes of Minnesota<br>To the hills of Tennessee<br>Across the plains of Texas<br>From sea to shining sea<br>From Detroit down to Houston<br>And New York to L.A.<br>Well, there's pride in every American heart<br>And it's time we stand and say

That I'm proud to be an American<br>Where at least I know I'm free<br>And I won't forget the men who died<br>Who gave that right to me<br>And I'd gladly stand up<br>Next to you and defend her still today<br>'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land (love this land)<br>God bless the USA

And I'm proud to be an American<br>Where at least I know I'm free<br>And I won't forget the men who died<br>Who gave that right to me<br>And I'd gladly stand up<br>Next to you and defend her still today<br>​​​​'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land (love this land)<br>God bless the USA
