## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,078**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! There are just over 100 days until we say goodbye to 2021 – and that means there *are still* 100 days to hustle so you can end Q4 with a well-deserved pat on the back\! As we prepare to descend into the final days of 2021, I’d like to challenge you to not only review your goals for this year, but to push the limits – what else is possible? Can you stretch a little more outside your comfort zone? What if you double down on your efforts? What could be the result? This week let’s think outside the box. Let’s think bigger. Can you do it? Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

One day a son came to his father for help.

“Dad, I can’t do this anymore,” he said, “Those lessons only exhaust me, and the result doesn’t change. It must be not destined for me to play football and my dream will never come true.”

The father looked at his son with loving eyes and said, “You know son, every person in life has a dream, a goal of his life. They are the ones that make us do what we are doing, because it’s what we should do. We have to fight for what we believe in, what we feel. In other case, you will simply break, once and for all.”

“The easiest way is to quit everything and not go until the end, because the path is difficult and we are not used to inconveniences. We want everything to be easy and at once. But the wishes are fleeting\! This is how our dream dies, and the goal becomes unreachable.”

“Gradually, life becomes a routine without depth and meaning. Then one day, we try to forget and start everything from the beginning, we wait for a new day to make our life different. But new obstacles come in our way, and we stop again. We become full of despair and anger for our own helplessness.”

“But you only need to remember one thing: never give up, fight, battle. It doesn’t matter that you have lost one battle and even dozens of battles. Life goes on\! Your biggest enemies are hiding in you – laziness, fear, doubt, indecision. Be a warrior of your dream, a knight of your goal and a soldier of your wishes\!”
