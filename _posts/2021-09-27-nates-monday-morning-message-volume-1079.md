## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,079**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you rested and ready for the new opportunities that are abound\! How did you do with the challenge I proposed in last week’s message? Are you ready to crush Q4?

As we usher in the fall season, that means cooler temps (or the perfect weather if you here in the Valley of the Sun\!), football Sundays and holiday preparations – before we know it, we will be ringing in the New Year\! Before you dust off the crystal and bust out your favorite bottle of bubbly, remember this is the perfect time to take inventory of your life so far this year – Are you happy? Are you grateful? Are you fulfilled? Are you healthy? Take the time to answer these questions with sincerity and clarity. Then ask yourself – What is 2022 going to look like? Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Leaves by Elsie N. Brady

How silently they tumble down<br>And come to rest upon the ground<br>To lay a carpet, rich and rare,<br>Beneath the trees without a care,<br>Content to sleep, their work well done,<br>Colors gleaming in the sun.

At other times, they wildly fly<br>Until they nearly reach the sky.<br>Twisting, turning through the air<br>Till all the trees stand stark and bare.<br>Exhausted, drop to earth below<br>To wait, like children, for the snow.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Keep your face always toward the sunshine - and shadows will fall behind you.” - Walt Whitman

“Be brave enough to live life creatively. The creative place where no one else has ever been.” – Alan Alda

“Follow your bliss and the universe will open doors where there were only walls.” - Joseph Campbell
