## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,081**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! Some of you reading this might be enjoying a long three-day weekend so I thought I’d take a moment to share the importance that this day signifies – the resilient Indigenous People. Rooted in history books is evidence that the American Indians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians built a vibrant and diverse culture steeped in tradition, language, spirit and knowledge which has been passed down across many generations. As the first inhabitants of America, their contribution to our country is invaluable – and their sacrifice immeasurable. On Indigenous Peoples Day, our Nation recognizes and honors their inherent sovereignty. Please take a moment today to pay your own homage to the Indigenous People who continue to help shape our great country. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

May the sun bring you new energy by day

May the moon softly restore you by night

May the rain wash away your worries

May the breeze blow new strength into your being

May you walk gently through the world and know its beauty all the days of your life

Apache Blessing

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“The ear does not belong to man, man belongs to the earth. All things area connected like the blood that unites us all. Man did not weave the web of life, he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself.” – Chief Seattle

“Listen to the Wind, it talks. Listen to the Silence, it speaks. Listen to your Heart, it knows.” – Unknown

“What is life? It is the flash of a firefly in the night. It is the breath of a buffalo in the wintertime. It is the little shadow which runs across the grass and loses itself in the sunset.” – Blackfoot
