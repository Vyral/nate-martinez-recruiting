## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,082**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! On October 12, 2021, I celebrated a milestone in my career as a real estate agent – 30 years with RE/MAX\! I can still remember the day I decided to leave West USA to join RE/MAX like it was yesterday. It was a decision that changed my life and more importantly, changed the lineage of my family and generations to come. Its surreal when I compare where I was 30 years ago, to where I am today – and the opportunities I have to continue to serve my community and those who I am proud to call RE/MAX Professionals.

I am sharing this with you today to remind you that every decision we make, no matter how big or small has a ripple effect. I had no idea 30 years ago that joining the number one brand in real estate would have such a massive impact. This week, I’d like to challenge you to think about your actions, your decisions – and consider the ripple effect. Then fast forward a year or two or 30 years into the future – how has that one decision changed your life? How has it changed your family? How has it changed your community? How has it changed your industry? How has it changed the world? Chose wisely. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Choices

There comes a time in your life, when you must decide,

No help from anyone, on which you've always relied.

Between right and wrong, between black and white,

Between good and bad, to walk away or fight.

To be honest and true. to be open with your heart, Or to hide your feelings, play it safe from the start.

To sit back and watch, to listen and learn,Or jump into the fire, taking a chance on a burn.

To stay. to move. to not care, or always prove.

To be strong, to be weak, to be aggressive, to be meek.

To laugh out loud with all your might, or smile a little just to be polite.

To stay together. to live apart. to think with your mind, or trust your with heart.

To live in the past. to always look back, to look ahead to the future, with ambition you won't lack.

Begun at the front. or start at the end, believe in your own self, or follow the trend.

To dream. to hope, to quit, to cope. To be a lover, to be a friend to be real, or just pretend.

Choices we make can make or break, to have to decide at all could be our worst fall.

Choices are sometimes deceiving, you can be lured by the sweetest bait.

So make your decision wisely, because to change your mind could be too late.

Life is about choices, for however we decide,We'll have to live with our decision until the day we have died.
