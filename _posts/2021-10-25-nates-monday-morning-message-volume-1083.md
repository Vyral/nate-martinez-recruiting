## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,083**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! It’s a spooky week ahead – are you ready for the count down to Halloween? October 31st is the beginning of the holiday season, and the new year which will be here sooner than we are prepared for. Life seems to speed up, while simultaneously providing us an opportunity to be ever-present with our family and friends. It starts with the costumes, the face painting, the candy corns and miniature snicker bars, the smell of cinnamon and spice, the cool air that fills the night. This is the week that reminds us that there is something significant about traditions – and those holiday traditions start this week. Happy Halloween\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Fun Halloween Facts:

* More people are buying costumes for their pets. Americans spent $490 million on costumes for their pets in 2019—more than double what they spent in 2010.
* Skittles are America's favorite candy. Candy corn is America's least favorite candy.
* The fear of Halloween is called Samhainophobia.
* Disney’s Hocus Pocus***&nbsp;***was originally called Halloween House. It is the most commercially successful horror film of all time.
* The Irish brought us jack-o'-lanterns. They used to be carved out of turnips, potatoes and beets.
* One quarter of all the candy sold annually in the U.S. is purchased for Halloween.
* The holiday dates back more than 2,000 years. Trick-or-treating has existed since medieval times.
* Now Halloween is the second largest commercial holiday in the country.
