## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,084**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope all your ghouls and goblins had a fun filled holiday weekend and with that the holiday season has officially begun\! This month I want to focus our weekly messages on how to successfully navigate the stress that can be brought on by this time of year. Today, let’s start with perfectionism – something all of us struggle with to some degree, me included. However, I’d like to share a different perspective of what “perfect” really means. We set ourselves up for disappointment when we try to control the outcome of every detail throughout the holidays. What if it was just “good enough?” What if the imperfection is exactly what it was meant to be? There is a divine beauty in the imperfections of life and especially the holidays. Before we dive in headfirst to all the hustle and bustle, I’d like to challenge you to let go a little. It doesn’t have to be perfect to be a beautiful experience. Accept the imperfections as the true gift of the season. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

A blind boy sat on the steps of a building with a hat by his feet. He held up a sign which read, “I am blind, please help.”

There were only a few coins in the hat – spare change from folks as they hurried past.

A man was walking by. He took a few coins from his pocket and dropped them into the hat. He then took the sign, turned it around, and wrote some words. Then he put the sign back in the boy’s hand so that everyone who walked by would see the new words.

Soon the hat began to fill up. A lot more people were giving money to the blind boy.

That afternoon, the man who had changed the sign returned to see how things were. The boy recognized his footsteps and asked, “Were you the one who changed my sign this morning? What did you write?”

The man said, “I only wrote the truth. I said what you said but in a different way.”

**I wrote, “Today is a beautiful day, but I cannot see it.”**

Both signs spoke the truth. But the first sign simply said the boy was blind, while the second sign conveyed to everyone walking by how grateful they should be to see.
