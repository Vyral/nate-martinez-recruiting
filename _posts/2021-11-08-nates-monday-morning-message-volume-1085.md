## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,085**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope each of you reading this are refreshed and ready for a new week ahead. Keeping with our theme this month, today I want to focus on what really matters during the holiday season – and how we can use simple tips to help us not lose sight of what is important. Let’s face it, the holidays can be hectic – added stress with long lines, overflowing parking lots and making money stretch to cover all the holiday needs. Here are a couple questions to ask yourself in those moments:

How does this affect the big picture? If you are irritated by the long lines in the department store, take a deep breath and remind yourself – it’s a just a line, not the end of the world.

How can you use this moment for something positive? While you are waiting in that long line, use the time to reflect on your life. What do you have to be positive or grateful for that happened today?

How can you turn this stressful moment a pleasant experience? Look around, notice something new or beautiful about your favorite store. Or make a point to connect with a fellow shopper with a kind word.

I hope you will use these suggestions to help you happily navigate the next few weeks with a little less stress\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

When the supermarket clerk tallied up my groceries, I was $12 over what I had on me. I began to remove items from the bags, when another shopper handed me a $20 bill. “Please don’t put yourself out,” I told him. “Let me tell you a story,” he said. “My mother is in the hospital with cancer. I visit her every day and bring her flowers. I went this morning, and she got mad at me for spending my money on more flowers. She demanded that I do something else with that money. So, here, please accept this. It is my mother’s flowers.” – Leslie Wagner, Peel, Arkansas

“Be happy for this moment. This moment is your life.” – Omar Khayyam
