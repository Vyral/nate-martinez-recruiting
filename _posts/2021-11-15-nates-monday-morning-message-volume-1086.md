## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,086**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope the weekend gave you time to decompress, recharge and refresh. Are you ready for Monday? Continuing with our theme this month, today’s topic is kindness. You can’t control how people handle their own stress during the holidays, however you can control how you chose to respond. Here are a few tips…

The next time you are faced with a difficult person, instead of assuming the worst about them, try to have some compassion. Perhaps they are suffering from an illness, or they lost a loved one, or maybe they are worried how they will pay for groceries this week. Its more than likely not about you, so don’t take it personal.

Remember to breath. If you are in a heated situation, pause and take a few deep breaths to help you shift the perspective in the moment.

Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

I forgot about the rules on liquids in carry-on luggage, so when I hit security at the airport, I had to give up all my painting supplies. When I returned a week later, an attendant was at the baggage area with my paints. Not only had he kept them for me, but he’d looked up my return date and time in order to meet me. – Marilyn Kinsella, Canmore, Canada.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“I shall pass through this world but once. Any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness I can show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer it or neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.” - Stephen Grellet

“No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.” – Aesop

“For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone.” - Audrey Hepburn
