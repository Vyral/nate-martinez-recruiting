Today I’ll discuss focus. In this crazy real estate market, it's not uncommon to get daily calls from someone trying to recruit you to their company or see TV commercials from iBuyers. There is a lot of noise out there. **My advice is to stay focused on the basics.**

For example, Tom Brady has been playing the same position for 20 years, yet he’s still excelling because he's mastered the basics. He understands every player’s role and takes full advantage of it. What are you doing to take advantage of this marketplace? Stay focused and do your basics every single day. At the end of the year, you'll have an amazing business.

If there's anything I can help you with regarding goal setting, business planning, or anything in the real estate space, I'd be happy to sit down with you and share my 35 years of knowledge. Please reach out to me at [natem@remax.net](mailto:natem@remax.net) or at 602-430-5226.
