## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,087**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! Well, this is the week…its Thanksgiving\! I know we say it every year, but this year feels like it flew by faster than any other. While this week is about the delicious turkey and the flavory stuffing, it’s also about tradition and gratitude. This will be the first year without my beloved mother at the table, so tradition has that much more meaning to me this Thanksgiving. If I have learned anything this last year without my mother, is that family traditions are what make the holiday season. Passing those traditions down to my children and grandchildren is a gift that I don’t take lightly…to honor and remember the woman who started it all. Thank you, mom.

As you gather on Thursday with your family and friends, please take a moment to share a simple word of gratitude for the traditions. From my family and team to yours, let me be the first to say happy Thanksgiving. Let’s make it a great week\!

**PS** You are invited\! We are hosting a 2-hour business planning workshop on Wednesday, December 8th from 3:00-5:00pm. Margaritas and appetizers will be provided\! [Click here](https://www.facebook.com/events/615537703024035) to RSVP.

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Thanksgiving Day by Lydia Maria Child

Over the river, and through the wood,<br>To grandfather's house we go;<br>The horse knows the way<br>To carry the sleigh<br>Through the white and drifted snow.

Over the river, and through the wood—<br>Oh, how the wind does blow\!<br>It stings the toes<br>And bites the nose<br>As over the ground we go.

Over the river, and through the wood,<br>To have a first-rate play.<br>Hear the bells ring<br>"Ting-a-ling-ding",<br>Hurrah for Thanksgiving Day\!

Over the river, and through the wood<br>Trot fast, my dapple-gray\!<br>Spring over the ground,<br>Like a hunting-hound\!<br>For this is Thanksgiving Day.

Over the river, and through the wood,<br>And straight through the barn-yard gate.<br>We seem to go<br>Extremely slow,—It is so hard to wait\!

Over the river and through the wood—<br>Now grandmother's cap I spy\!<br>Hurrah for the fun\!<br>Is the pudding done?<br>Hurrah for the pumpkin-pie\!
