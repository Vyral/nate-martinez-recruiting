## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,088**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope that this email finds you well and that each of you had a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday celebration\! The New Year will be here before we know it so today, I’d like to share a few thoughts about resolutions.

Start small. Change can be done slowly and gradually, which creates a compound effect. Break your goals down into smaller steps that can be accomplished throughout the year.

Be kind to yourself. Self-care and self-love are critical if you want to achieve your goals in 2022. If you have a bad day, tomorrow is a new start. Have compassion for your humanness and know that great things are accomplished with the first step, no matter how messy it might be to get to the first step.

I’d love to hear about your goals for 2022 – shoot me a email and let’s support each other\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**PS** You are invited\! We are hosting a 2-hour business planning workshop on Wednesday, December 8th from 3:00-5:00pm. Margaritas and appetizers will be provided\! [Click here](https://www.facebook.com/events/615537703024035) to RSVP.

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

For your 2022 goals, consider using the SMART acronym to help you achieve success:

S – Specific<br>M – Measurable<br>A – Achievable<br>R – Realistic<br>T - Timely

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do.” - Sarah Ban Breathnach

“The more you can dream, the more you can do.” – Michael Korda
