## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,090**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! Let’s make it a great week\! I want to start by saying THANK YOU to the amazing agents at RE/MAX Professionals who rocked the Hometown Christmas Parade in Glendale this weekend. They stepped up to volunteer their time and resources – and it was remarkable\! We had a great time with the kiddos and Santa – we could not have done it without the support and help of each person. I am so grateful for them and the community we have the privilege of serving. If you were there on Saturday, I hope you had a great time – what a wonderful way to celebrate the holiday season. As you prepare for this week, I hope you will consider volunteering your time or resources to a worthy cause that makes a difference this holiday season. Many hands, make for light work. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

I saw a dress in a consignment shop that I knew my granddaughter would love. But money was tight, so I asked the store owner if she could hold it for me. “May I buy the dress for you?” asked another customer. “Thank you, but I can’t accept such a gracious gift,” I said. Then she told me why it was so important for her to help me. She’d been homeless for three years, she said, and had it not been for the kindness of strangers, she would not have been able to survive. “I’m no longer homeless, and my situation has improved,” she said. “I promised myself that I would repay the kindness so many had shown me.” She paid for the dress, and the only payment she would accept in return was a heartfelt hug. – Stacy Lee, Columbia, Maryland.
