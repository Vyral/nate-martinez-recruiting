**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

“How the Grinch Stole Christmas” by Dr. Suess

…So he paused. And the Grinch put his hand to his ear.<br>And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.<br>It started in low. Then it started to grow.<br>But the sound wasn't sad\! Why, this sound sounded merry\!<br>It couldn't be so\! But it WAS merry\! VERY\!<br>He stared down at Whoville\! The Grinch popped his eyes\!<br>Then he shook\! What he saw was a shocking surprise\!<br>Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small,<br>Was singing\! Without any presents at all\!<br>He HADN'T stopped Christmas from coming\! IT CAME\!<br>Somehow or other, it came just the same\!<br>And the Grinch, with his grinch-feet ice-cold in the snow,<br>Stood puzzling and puzzling: "How could it be so?"<br>"It came without ribbons\! It came without tags\!"<br>"It came without packages, boxes or bags\!"<br>And he puzzled three hours, till his puzzler was sore.<br>Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before\!<br>"Maybe Christmas," he thought, "doesn't come from a store."<br>"Maybe Christmas...perhaps...means a little bit more\!”
