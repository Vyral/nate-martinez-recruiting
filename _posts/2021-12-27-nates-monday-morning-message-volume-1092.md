## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,092**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message…I hope you had a wonderful holiday weekend\! We are on the final stretch of 2021, which means it is time to set our resolutions, goals and plans for 2022. I’d love to hear what you have envisioned for your life, business, family in the New Year so please feel free to shoot me an email, text or a phone call. This is the perfect time of year to elevate our accountability and go after what we are meant to have. We all have potential. We all have gifts and abilities. What does 2022 look like for you? Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

**Denmark**

Residents of Denmark greet the New Year by throwing old plates and glasses against the doors of family and friends to banish bad spirits. They also stand on chairs and jump off of them together at midnight to “leap” into January in hopes of good luck.

**Spain**

In Spain, it is customary to eat 12 grapes – one at each stroke of the clock at midnight on New Year’s Eve. Each grape represents good luck for one month of the coming year. In bigger cities like Madrid and Barcelona, people gather in main squares to eat their grapes together and pass around bottles of cava.

**Brazil**

In Brazil, as well as other Central and South America countries like Ecuador, Bolivia, and Venezuela, it is thought to be lucky to wear special underwear on New Year’s Eve. The most popular colors are red, thought to bring love in the New Year, and yellow, thought to bring money.

**Greece**

An onion is traditionally hung on the front door of homes on New Year’s Even in Greece as a symbol of rebirth in the New Year. On New Year’s Day, parents wake their children by tapping them on the head with the onion.

**America**

Crowds have been gathering in New York City's Times Square to watch the ball drop since 1907. And while the first one was just iron and wood, today you can watch a 12-foot, 11,875-pound geodesic sphere covered in 2,688 Waterford Crystal triangles and 32,256 LEDs make its descent, even from the warmth and comfort of your own home.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Let our new year’s resolutions be this: we will be there for one another as fellow members of humanity, in the finest sense of the word.” Goran Persson

“Cheers to a new year and another chance to for us to get it right.” – Oprah Winfrey

“For last year’s words belong to last year’s language and new year’s words await another voice.” T.S. Eliot
