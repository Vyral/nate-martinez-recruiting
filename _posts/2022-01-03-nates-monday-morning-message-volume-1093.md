## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,093**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message…welcome to 2022\! I trust that the New Year has been good for you so far and that you were able to celebrate with your family and friends. This is the time of year when we set our resolutions but for many, by February those goals have been abandoned for old habits and stuck thinking. Below I am sharing a fresh, unique perspective to set yourself up for a winning year. And I’d love to hear from you\! Shoot me an email and let me know what your New Year’s resolutions are. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Pick one word for the year: keep things simple, clear and precise with just one word that is centered around your goals for 2022. Some ideas are, joy, harmony, action, present, rise, intentional. You get the idea.

Make a list of things you are looking forward to: listings out the things you are looking forward to throughout the year will put you in a hopeful state of mind which transcends to a positive outlook in general. These could be a list of new technology coming out, a new movie or TV show, a vacation or anniversary.

Plan a 365-day project: decide on something you can commit to doing every day in 2022. Keep it simple. Some ideas might include not hitting snooze in the morning, reading to your child before bed, journaling your gratitudes, writing a thank you note, posting a photo on social media.

Set just one goal for the year: instead of a New Year’s resolution, this would be a goal that you have the whole year to accomplish. Maybe learn a new language, learn a new hobby or sport, hike the Grand Canyon or complete a marathon.

Make a 2022 bucket list: this could be a list of new foods you want to try, a trip you want to take, a concert you want to see, an activity like jumping out of a plane.

Create a 30-day challenge for each month: this would be twelve, attainable challenges that you can accomplish in 30 days. Write down the specific actions you will need to do to hit the goal.

Decide on what you would like to measure this year: “what gets measured, gets managed.” Measuring or tracking things like how many calories you eat, how many steps you take, how many times you golf or practice your guitar, how many dates you go on with your spouse.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream; not only plan, but also believe.” – Anatole France

“Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or lose.” – Lyndon B. Johnson
