## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,094**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope that each of you are healthy, happy and safe as we enter into another new week in the New Year. Have you thought about your goals and resolutions? Don’t forget to send me a message, I’d love to hear more about your plans for 2022. I am inspired by the story of Thomas Edison and what a great reminder for all of us – no matter how many times you attempt something, if you don’t succeed, it’s not a failure because you learned something from trying. Think about how different our world might look (or not look) if Edison had given up after the first two thousand elements had failed? The lesson from this story is to not give up – you got this\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**PS** You invited on Thursday to hear a panel of your peers talk about the important topic: Protect Your Commission. This will be streamed live started at 9am on Thursday, January 13th. Please [click here](https://www.facebook.com/events/886467638732806) to let us know you will be attending.

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Thomas Edison tried two thousand different materials in search of a filament for the light bulb. When none worked satisfactorily, his assistant complained, “All our work is in vain. We have learned nothing.”&nbsp;

Edison replied very confidently, “Oh, we have come a long way and we have learned a lot. We know that there are two thousand elements which we cannot use to make a good light bulb.”

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Character is the result of two things: mental attitude and the way we spend our time.” - Elbert Hubbard

“Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.” - Winston Churchill

“Nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude.” - Thomas Jefferson
