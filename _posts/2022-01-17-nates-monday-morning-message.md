## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,095**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! Today, I would like to take this time to remember and honor a great man in our history – Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. I hope you will join me in a moment of remembrance today for his passion for this country, his unwavering hope for change, and his commitment to equality for all men and women. Thank you, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Excerpt taken from the famous I Have a Dream speech, delivered by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on August 28, 1963, at Lincoln Memorial, Washington D.C.

And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

I have a *dream* today\!

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“We may have all come on different ships, but we're in the same boat now.” - Martin Luther King, Jr.

“I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear.” - Martin Luther King, Jr.
