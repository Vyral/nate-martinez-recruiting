## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,096**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I read this quote the other day and it has inspired my message today: “The beginning is the most important part of the work.” – Plato. In order to succeed, you must start somewhere. Every thought you have, can lead to an idea which changes the world. But you have to start. Start from where you are, with what you have – and trust that a way will be made if you want it bad enough. The beginning, the start – its where the magic lives. Don’t waste any more time – get started today. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Life's Little Instructions

Every so often you push your luck.

Never underestimate the power of a kind word or deed.

Never give up on anybody -- miracles happen every day.

Become the most positive and enthusiastic person you know.

Learn to listen.

Think big thoughts, but relish small pleasures.

Don't expect others to listen to your advice or ignore your example.

Opportunity sometimes knocks very softly.

Leave everything a little better than you found it.

Don't forget: a person's emotional need is to feel appreciated.

Never waste an opportunity to tell someone you love them.

Treat everyone you meet like you want to be treated.

Make new friends but cherish the old ones.

Don't use time or words carelessly, neither can be retrieved.

Judge your success by the degree that you're enjoying peace, health, and love.

Smile a lot: it costs nothing and is beyond price.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience.” – Paulo Coelho

“The secret to happiness is freedom... And the secret to freedom is courage.” – Thucydides

“Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.” - T. S. Eliot
