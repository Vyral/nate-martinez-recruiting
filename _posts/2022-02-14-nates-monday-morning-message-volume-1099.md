## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,099**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you well and that you had a wonderful weekend with family and loved ones. Let’s start this week with a thought about history, and not history in a schoolbook but rather how history impacts your goals in life. When you set your goals or think about your potential, so many of us base it on what we did in the past – which can be a great place to start. However, I’d like to challenge you for a moment with this question: what if you are where you are today, not because what you did in the past, but what you didn’t do? I know that is a heavy question. But it’s a gamechanger. What are you avoiding in your life? What weaknesses are you favoring? What are you afraid of? What didn’t you do that is keeping you from living up to your full potential? Answer these questions and you can change the rules of the game. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

I was balancing caring for a toddler and working a full-time job, all while my Navy husband was on extended duty overseas. One evening, the doorbell rang. It was my neighbor, a retired chief petty officer, holding a breadboard loaded with a freshly cooked chicken and vegetable stew. “I’ve noticed you’re getting a little skinny,” he said. It was the best meal I’d had in months. – Patricia Fordney, Corvallis, Oregon

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“To accomplish great things we must first dream, then visualize, then plan... believe... act\!” - Alfred A. Montapert

“Only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone.” - Pablo Picasso

“There are no rules of architecture for a castle in the clouds.” - Gilbert K. Chesterton
