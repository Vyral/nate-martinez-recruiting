## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,099**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I know many of you reading this will be enjoying a long weekend with the day off in honor of Presidents Day – which was originally established in 1885 in recognition of President George Washington. Today, we celebrate all president’s past and present – regardless of party or whether our guy won or not. To be the president of the greatest country in the world, is a responsibility that goes beyond measure – a daily sacrifice that only a person walking in those shoes can begin to comprehend. On this day, I want to say THANK YOU. We are the United States of America, because of every president who has answered the call to represent our great nation. I hope you’ll take a moment to reflect and share your own gratitudes on this day of recognition. Let’s make it a great week\!
