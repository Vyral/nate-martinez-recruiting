## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,101**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! This week I will be surrounded by some of the best in the real estate industry, brilliant speakers and teachers, and the agents who will be representing RE/MAX Professionals at the 49th annual RE/MAX convention in Las Vegas, Nevada.

I have been with the RE/MAX family since 1991 and I have not missed one convention, as I have found the opportunities to develop my skills as a REALTOR&reg; as well as the networking opportunities with my fellow RE/MAX agents from around the world, has been invaluable to my career. I have always been the guy sitting in the front row, learning everything I can to be the best that I can. I see it as we have two options: to be learning, or to be dying. Which are you doing this today? Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>And sorry I could not travel both<br>And be one traveler, long I stood

And looked down one as far as I could<br>To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>And having perhaps the better claim,<br>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>Though as for that the passing there<br>Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay<br>In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>Oh, I kept the first for another day\!

Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—I took the one less traveled by,<br>And that has made all the difference.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Keep your face always toward the sunshine - and shadows will fall behind you.” - Walt Whitman

“It is never too late to be what you might have been.” - George Eliot

“Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.” - Robert Louis Stevenson
