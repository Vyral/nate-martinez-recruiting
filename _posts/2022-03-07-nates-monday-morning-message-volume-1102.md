## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,102**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! As you read last week, I spent the week in Las Vegas attending the 49th annual RE/MAX convention. It was a jam-packed week of learning, networking and celebrating the milestone of my team’s achievements from 2021 and those we have the privilege to work with at RE/MAX Professionals.

For the first time in real estate history, RE/MAX became the first real estate brand to sell more than two million homes worldwide – wow\! What an honor it is to be surrounded by the best-of-the-best in our industry and to be able to provide the level of service we do for our clients so that we can have this type of reach around the globe. I want to thank each of you reading this email for your trust and confidence over the past 35+ years. This gratitude is extended to the agents who call themselves RE/MAX Professionals – we could not have accomplished this greatness without each of you\! THANK YOU\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

24 Thoughts Never To Forget...

Your presence is a present to the world.<br>You're unique and one of a kind.<br>Your life can be what you want it to be.

Take the days just one at a time.<br>Count your blessings, not your troubles.<br>You'll make it through whatever comes along.<br>Within you are so many answers.<br>Understand, have courage, be strong.

Don't put limits on yourself.<br>So many dreams are waiting to be realized.<br>Decisions are too important to leave to chance.

Reach for your peak, your goal, your prize.<br>Nothing wastes more energy than worrying.<br>The longer one carries a problem, the heavier it gets.

Don't take things too seriously.<br>Live a life of serenity, not a life of regrets.<br>Remember that a little love goes a long way…Remember that a lot…goes forever.<br>Remember that friendship is a wise investment.

Life's treasures are people…together.<br>Realize that it's never too late.<br>Do ordinary things in an extraordinary way.<br>Have health and hope and happiness.

Take time to wish upon a star.<br>And don't ever forget…for even a day…How very special you are.&nbsp;
