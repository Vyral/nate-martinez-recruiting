## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,103**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I heard this quote the other day, which has inspired me for today’s message… “the words I speak are the house I live in.” That got me thinking, especially because, as you know, we sell a few houses around here\! Our home is so much more than the place we put our head down to sleep at night. It’s our bodies, it’s our families, it’s our health, it’s our dreams, it’s our struggles, but most importantly, its our mindset. What we think, we speak, and what we speak becomes our reality. Choose your words wisely, because the words you speak, are the house you live in. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

In 2015, nine-year-old Marlee Pack was informed that she was suffering from alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare form of soft tissue cancer. Marlee was forced to miss a lot of school due to her treatment, which involved weeks of grueling chemotherapy. When the time came for Marlee to return to class at Meridian Elementary School in Broomfield, Colorado, she felt worried about being the only one with a shaved head. That’s when her friend Cameron McLaughlin decided to shave her head in solidarity with her close pal. 80 students and some teachers from the school followed suit, all shaving their heads in support of Marlee at a school event called “Be Bold, Be Brave, Go Bald”. The event raised more than $25,000 (&pound;19,000\] for St Baldrick’s Foundation, a childhood cancer research organization. “I didn’t think that many people would shave their heads, but I feel good about going back to school and not being the only bald one,” Marlee told Today.com.
