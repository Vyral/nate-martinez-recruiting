## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,104**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you well, refreshed and ready to accomplish another week. Last week we talked about choosing your words wisely – how did that go for you over the past week? There is so much noise in our world today, and much negativity that it can be a challenge to focus on the good. Today, I’d like to gently remind you that no matter what is happening with the world, no matter how bleak things might seem, there is always something good to see around you. Even as small as a newly budding tree, a beautiful sunrise, the sound of a child’s laughter, or the smell of a freshly brewed cup of coffee – there is always something that you can be grateful for. This week, turn off the news, put down your cell phone and take a moment to breath in life. There is *always* something good. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

One cowardly person came to a master of martial arts and asked to teach him bravery. The master looked at him and said:

“I will teach you only with one condition: one month you will have to live in a big city and tell every person that you meet on your way that you are a coward. You will have to say it loudly, openly and looking straight into the person’s eyes.”

The person got really sad, because this task seemed very scary to him. For a couple of days he was very sad and thoughtful, but to live with his cowardice was so unbearable that he travelled to the city to accomplish his mission.

At first, when meeting the passers, he quailed, lost his speech and couldn’t contact anyone. But he needed to finish the master’s task, so he began to overcome himself. When he came up to his first passer to talk about his cowardice, it seemed to him that he would die from fear. But his voice sounded louder and more confident with every passing day. Suddenly came a moment, when the man caught himself thinking that he’s not scared anymore, and the further he continued doing the master’s task, the more convinced he was that the fear was abandoning him. That way a month had passed. The person came back to the master, bowed to him and said:

"Thank you, teacher. I finished your task. Now I’m not afraid anymore. But how did you know that this strange task will help me?

“The thing is that cowardice is only a habit. And by doing the things that scare us, we can destroy the stereotypes and come to a conclusion that you came to. And now you know that bravery – is also a habit. And if you want to make bravery a part of yourself- you need to move forward into the fear. Then the fear will go away, and bravery will take its place.”
