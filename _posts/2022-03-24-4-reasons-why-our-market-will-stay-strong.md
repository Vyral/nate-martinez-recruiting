Is our market going to crash? I get this question almost every day, and my answer is a hard no. The demand for real estate in our Phoenix market is unheard of, and besides that, there are four good reasons why our market is still strong:

**1\. Multiple offers.** Even after 16 months of a competitive market, we still see multiple-offer situations, so demand is not letting up.

**2\. Low inventory.** This goes back to supply and demand. We have a very small supply of homes and a huge demand from buyers.

**3\. Job creation.** There are cranes and new manufacturing plants everywhere you look in Phoenix. Another 150,000 homes are supposed to be built in the north Phoenix valley soon.&nbsp;

**4\. Price appreciation.** Homes increased in value by 32% last year. There is a lot of equity in the market, and it shows no signs of slowing down.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about the market or just want to chat, give me a call at (602) 942-7000. I’d love to hear from you.
