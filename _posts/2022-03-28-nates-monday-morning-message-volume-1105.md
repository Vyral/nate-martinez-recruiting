## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,105**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! It’s the last week of Q1 of 2022 – how are you doing with your goals so far? Are you on track or do you need to make some adjustments? I was going through an old notebook the other day, and I came across some notes I wrote in 2018 on a few goals I wanted to accomplish. As I read through them, I couldn’t help but smile and be reminded of the power of intentionally planning your life. Many of the things I wrote down I had accomplished. This week, I want to encourage you to review your progress so far for 2022 – reflect on what is working and revise what is not. Reset, refocus and let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

There was a man, who lived in the mountain village, and he was known because he has never argued with anyone. One day some correspondent, who wished to write about this man in the Guinness book of records, came to him. They had the following conversation:

“Please tell me, is it true, that you have lived more than 90 years and never argued with anyone?”

“Yes, it is true.”

“Absolutely with no one? Absolutely with no one, at all\! Even with your wife?

“Even with my wife.”

“Even with your children?”

“Even with my children.”

“Not once for 90 years?”

“Not once.”

“Not once absolutely with no one?” — becoming angry, the correspondent asked.

“Yes,” —the old man said quietly.

The correspondent (blushing and becoming irritated): “It can‘t be, that you had not argued with anyone for all your life\!”

“I had, had, had…” the old man said apologetically.
