## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,106**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! Spring has sprung and before we know it, the triple digits will be here in the Valley of the Sun\! As the season changes, change is a great topic for today’s message. Most of us don’t enjoy change, however, there are very few things in life that are a guarantee and change happens to be one of them. While some changes can be painful and uncomfortable, there is also something beautiful and unique with every change we experience – we can gracefully accept that change is inevitable, or we can create resistance which leads to more pain and discomfort. How do you handle change? I’d love to hear from you\! This week, I want to challenge you to embrace change and look for the opportunity to grow and become a newer version of yourself. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Sometimes your biggest weakness can become your biggest strength. Take, for example, the story of one 10-year-old boy who decided to study judo despite the fact that he had lost his left arm in a devastating car accident.

The boy began lessons with an old Japanese judo master. The boy was doing well, so he couldn't understand why, after three months of training the master had taught him only one move.

"Sensei," the boy finally said, "Shouldn't I be learning more moves?"

"This is the only move you know, but this is the only move you'll ever need to know," the sensei replied.

Not quite understanding, but believing in his teacher, the boy kept training.

Several months later, the sensei took the boy to his first tournament. Surprising himself, the boy easily won his first two matches. The third match proved to be more difficult, but after some time, his opponent became impatient and charged; the boy deftly used his one move to win the match. Still amazed by his success, the boy was now in the finals.

This time, his opponent was bigger, stronger, and more experienced. For a while, the boy appeared to be overmatched. Concerned that the boy might get hurt, the referee called a time-out. He was about to stop the match when the sensei intervened.

"No," the sensei insisted, "Let him continue."

Soon after the match resumed, his opponent made a critical mistake: he dropped his guard. Instantly, the boy used his move to pin him. The boy had won the match and the tournament. He was the champion.

On the way home, the boy and sensei reviewed every move in each and every match. Then the boy summoned the courage to ask what was really on his mind.

"Sensei, how did I win the tournament with only one move?"

"You won for two reasons," the sensei answered. "First, you've almost mastered one of the most difficult throws in all of judo. And second, the only known defense for that move is for your opponent to grip your left arm."

The boy's biggest weakness had become his biggest strength.
