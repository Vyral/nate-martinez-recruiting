## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,107**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! How did your week go? Did you find an opportunity to embrace the changes in your life? I’d love to hear from you\! This week let’s talk about the real estate market and more importantly interest rates. If you are in the industry, you know that rates took a bit of a hike last week – and if you are an active buyer in the market, this might have you concerned about the affordability. When I bought my first house, the interest rate on my loan was 18 percent – we have come a long way\!

For years, we have been spoiled and perhaps we have taken for granted the low, low interest rates. There are many factors contributing to the Fed’s decision to raise the rates, and I won’t bore you with the complexities of inflation and how the real estate industry contributes. What I do want to share, is this – we can’t control the interest rates, we can’t control inflation, we can’t control what someone is willing to pay for a home. What we can control is our decision to be a homeowner. The vast benefits of owning your own home (or two or three) far outweigh paying a little more in interest, especially if you plan to occupy the home for 10+ years.

I have been blessed to serve my community for more than 35 years and I have experienced many different markets, including the great crash – if you are thinking we will experience that again, and you are waiting to buy, please reach out to me today. If you are an agent struggling to find your clients homes, let’s connect. If you are a homeowner and would love to sell but you don’t know where you’d go, please give me a call - none of our clients have ever been homeless\!

Our decisions are the only thing we can control. Remember that. Let’s make it a great week\!
