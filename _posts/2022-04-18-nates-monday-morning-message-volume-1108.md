## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,108**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you well, rested and that you had a lovely weekend celebrating with family and friends. Today, I want to talk about priorities. Over the years, our priorities change – for example, when my children were young, they were my priority – to provide a beautiful home, a good education – now as they are grown and started their own families, my priority is now my grandchildren. I wasn’t always great at putting my priorities in the right order, which was painful and costly, in many ways. It takes an effort, and it takes acknowledging what your priorities are – how important are they? Are you willing to move mountains for them? Are you willing to sacrifice? Are you willing to do whatever it takes? This week, I’d like to challenge you to reconsider your priorities – and ask yourself if they are in the right order so you can live your best life – and your family can too. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Imagine that you are juggling five balls.

Each of them is representing important parts of our life – family, health, spirit, friends and work.

Four balls are made of glass and only one is made of rubber.

We need to recognize that work is a rubber ball. While family, friends, health and spirit are very fragile, and if you drop one of them, they will be irreversibly damaged or even shattered.

This understanding will help to keep the balance in your life.
