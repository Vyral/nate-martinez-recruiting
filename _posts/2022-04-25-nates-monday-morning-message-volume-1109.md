## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,109**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you well, rested, and optimistic for the week that is ahead of us. Today, I want to talk about fear. There is a lot going on in our world, both here in the U.S. and around the globe that is scary and uncertain – most of it is outside of our control – yet I believe there are some of people putting their life on hold because of what they hear or read in the news. For me, the word “fear” stands for “false evidence, appearing real.” Now, I share that not to diminish what is happening in our world, because that is very much real, however there are plenty of challenges or perceptions that we make into a much bigger deal than they need to be – which leaves us crippled by false evidence, appearing real. This week, I want to challenge you to turn off the news and tune into your heart’s desires, focus on your family, take a walk with dog – get quiet and breath. What fears are holding you back right now that you need to let go of? I’d love to hear them – shoot me an email, or a text\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

John and his friends used to go mountain climbing once every year. This time they have decided to climb mountains in the Swiss Alps. They reached the famous mountain spot in the Swiss Alps and were surprised to see many people climbing the mountains.

John and his friends started wearing all the mountain climbing gear and started climbing. In no time, they reached the top of the hill. After reaching there, friends decided to camp there.

Then John saw another mountain where only a handful of people were trying to climb it.

He told his friends, “Let us go and climb that mountain also. It will be fun and challenging instead of camping here.”

A friend replied, “No way, I have heard people talking about that mountain. It seems the path is difficult to climb, and only a few people can able to climb.”

People nearby hearing the conversation made fun of John and said, “If it was easy to climb, why we were sitting idle here.” Hearing them, John took that as a challenge and went alone towards climbing the peak.

Two hours later, he reached the top of the hill. People who were already there welcomed John with a round of applause. John was happy having climbed the peak. He could see the beautiful views of nature from the top.

He started a conversation with people and asked them, “While climbing this peak, I felt it was not so difficult. Then why only a handful of people here? If people could climb the below peak, they can climb here also if they put in some effort.”

A veteran climber replied, “Most people in the crowd right there are happy with what they find easy. They never think that they have the potential to achieve more. Even people who are not happy there do not want to take any risk. They think if we take risks, they will lose what they already have. But to reach a new peak, we need to put in our effort. Many of them do not show any courage, and they remain part of the crowd the whole life. And keep complaining about the handful of courageous people and call them lucky.”

Hearing this, John thanked the veteran for explaining the importance of courage in our life.

**Moral of the story**

In our life, many of us stay in our comfort zone. But to achieve something big, we need effort and courage. We should never stop, have the courage to push ourselves out of the crowd.&nbsp;
