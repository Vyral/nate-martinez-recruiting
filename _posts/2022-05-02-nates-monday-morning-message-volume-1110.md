## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,110**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! This past week I had the great privilege of witnessing a few of our agents receive an award at our local board for their hard work helping families with their real estate needs. One of the core values we live by at RE/MAX Professionals is recognition, because we know the power that a word of congratulations, or a job well done shout out can do for someone’s day, their life, their business – and ultimately how it impacts their family. Recognition feels good. It creates momentum. It inspires. This week, I’d like to ask each of you to take a moment and recognize someone in your life – your child for a good grade at school – your spouse for picking up the groceries – your business partner for their collaboration on a new idea – the cashier at the store for their hard work – “good job” goes a long way in making a difference in our world. Let’s make it a great week\!
