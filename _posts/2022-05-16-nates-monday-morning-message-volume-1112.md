## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,112**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! This week I want to talk about attitude – every day we have the opportunity to choose our attitude – whether its going to be a good day or a stressful day. We have the choice to show up and do the work that gets us closer to living our best life, or we can blow it off with an excuse. We have a choice – and our attitude determines the choices we make. Today is your day. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

I will tell you a story of my friend Monty Roberts.

As he was a kid, his father as a horse trainer was moving from stable to stable, from ranch to ranch, training horses. Thus, the boy‘s school career was constantly interrupted. One day, when he was a senior, teacher asked him to write about what he wanted to be when he grew up. He did not hesitate a minute and wrote seven-page paper about his aim to be an owner of a horse ranch, he wrote many details and drew a location of buildings and stables and even a detailed house plan.

Two days later he received his paper back with letter F on the front page. After class he came to teacher and asked: “Why did I receive an F?“ The teacher responded: “This dreams is so unrealistic for a boy like you, who has no money, no resources and who comes from itinerant family. There is no possibility that you will reach your great goals one day.“ Then the teacher offered to rewrite the paper with more realistic attitude.

The boy went home and asked his father, how he should act. The father answered: “This decision is very important for you. So you have to make your own mind on this“.

After several days the boy brought the same paper to his teacher. No changes were made. He said: “Keep the F and I will keep my dream.“

Now Monty Roberts owns 4,000-square-foot house in the middle of 200-acre horse ranch and he still has that school paper, which now is framed over the fireplace.

Remember, you have to follow your heart, never give up, move on with determination and persistence, and never let anyone take your dreams away.
