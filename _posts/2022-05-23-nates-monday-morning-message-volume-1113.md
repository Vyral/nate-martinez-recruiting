## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,113**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you well, rested and ready to greet the new week with a positive attitude. Last week we talked about attitude – how did it go for you? Today, let’s talk about expectations. Even the most motivated, self-starter in the world will fail if they are unclear about the expectation or the end result. When a goal is set, there has to be a clear expectation or desired result, otherwise we could fail, or experience frustration and anxiety. This week, I’d like to challenge you to reset your vision and take a moment to get clear about the expectations that you have for your life. Are they in alignment with your purpose? Do they support your values? Do they positively impact the world around you? And as always, I’d love to hear from you – shoot me an email or give me a call\! Let’s make it a great week\!
