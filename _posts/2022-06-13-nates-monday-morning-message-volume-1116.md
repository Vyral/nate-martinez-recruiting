## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,116**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you well, and ready for the new week. How did it go last week with managing your self-care? Any ah-has? I’d love to hear about them\! Tomorrow is a special day however, its not a day that gets as much recognition as it should. On June 14, 1885 a small-town Wisconsin teach named Bernard Cigrand came up with the idea to have an annual day to recognize our American Flag. It was later passed by Congress to become a national observation and was signed into law by President Truman. This day commemorates the adoption of stars and stripes as the flag to officially represent the United States of America – and it’s a symbol of freedom. I hope tomorrow you will hang a flag and remember how we got that right. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

I Am Old Glory, Originally written by Master Sergeant Percy Webb, USMC

I Am Old Glory: For more than ten score years I have been the banner of hope and freedom for generation after generation of Americans.<br>Born amid the first flames of America's fight for freedom, I am the symbol of a country that has grown from a little group of thirteen colonies to a united nation of fifty sovereign states.<br>Planted firmly on the high pinnacle of American Faith my gently fluttering folds have proved an inspiration to untold millions.<br>Men have followed me into battle with unwavering courage.<br>They have looked upon me as a symbol of national unity.<br>They have prayed that they and their fellow citizens might continue to enjoy the life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, which have been granted to every American as the heritage of free men.<br>So long as men love liberty more than life itself; so long as they treasure the priceless privileges bought with the blood of our forefathers; so long as the principles of truth, justice and charity for all remain deeply rooted in human hearts, I shall continue to be the enduring banner of the United States of America.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Patriotism consists not in waving the flag, but in striving that our country shall be righteous as well as strong.” - James Bryce

“I believe our flag is more than just cloth and ink. It is a universally recognized symbol that stands for liberty, and freedom. It is the history of our nation, and it's marked by the blood of those who died defending it.” - John Thune

“To survive in peace and harmony, united and strong, we must have one people, one nation, one flag.” - Pauline Hanson
