## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,117**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I just got back from a week away, half of it was spent visiting my stepson who is preparing to move overseas for the next three years. We are very proud of Brennan’s dedication to the US military and while we will miss him, we know that he has an important job to do. The other half of our trip was spent in Dallas at a real estate conference. For more than thirty-five years I have spent countless hours attending events like this so I can continue to learn and develop my skills. Education is a critical key to success, in any industry. What are you doing to continue to improve your craft? What classes or conference do you plan to attend? What books are you reading? What masterminds are you attending? This week I’d like to challenge you to find a tool that will help you become a better version of yourself. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

**The Butterfly**

One day a small opening appeared. He sat and watched the butterfly for several hours as it struggled to force its body through that little hole.

Until it suddenly stopped making any progress and looked like it was stuck.

So, the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a pair of scissors and snipped off the remaining bit of the cocoon. The butterfly then emerged easily, although it had a swollen body and small, shriveled wings.

The man didn’t think anything of it and sat there waiting for the wings to enlarge to support the butterfly. But that didn’t happen. The butterfly spent the rest of its life unable to fly, crawling around with tiny wings and a swollen body.

Despite the kind heart of the man, he didn’t understand that the restricting cocoon and the struggle needed by the butterfly to get itself through the small opening; were nature’s way of forcing fluid from the body of the butterfly into its wings. To prepare itself for flying once it was out of the cocoon.

**Moral of the story:**

Our&nbsp;**struggles in life develop our strengths**. Without struggles, we never grow and never get stronger, so it’s important for us to tackle challenges on our own, and not be relying on help from others.
