## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,118**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message. Today I want to talk about the power of teamwork. When I decided to start a real estate team many years ago, it was so we could help more people buy or sell a home and be the number one team in the Valley of the Sun. I had no idea the impact that decision would have on my life and those who joined my team over the past thirty + years. In the beginning of my career, I thought I could do it all – I was the only one who could do it just right. But I realized, with the help of others, we could do so much more. I just had to ask.

This week I’d like to challenge you to think about where in your life that you could ask for help – and how does that support change your life and your goals? If you are the person who “does it all” for everyone in your life – I’d like to challenge you to get uncomfortable for a moment. The folks in your life want to give back and by always being the one to do it all, you are robbing them of the joy that they would experience if they had a chance to do something for you. &nbsp;If you need or want help, just ask – I promise someone will show up and if they don’t, call me and I’ll be there. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

A father watched his son try to lift a heavy stone. He failed with each attempt. After some time, his father came by and asked, “Are you using all your strength?” “Yes\!” the boy cried. His father looked at him and said, “No, you are not, I am here waiting, and you haven’t asked for my help.”
