## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,120**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message…it’s a new week\! Are you ready? I heard a saying years ago that I want to share as my inspiration for today’s message: be interested, not interesting. What does that mean? Most of the time, people are focused on being interesting, which makes it all about them. But when we are interested, we create an opportunity to communicate more effectively which deepens the connection we share. This week, I’d like to challenge you to find one person you can practice this with. Be genuinely interested in learning something new about them, and let’s see how that changes our conversations. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

Can you imagine living in a place where everyone but you spoke the same language? Such was life for Muaharrem, a deaf man in Istanbul who uses sign language to communicate. Muaharrem spent every day communicating with people in his town the best he could. He may have gotten by but was never able to truly live. Until one day, when a Samsung ad created a new world for him that he never thought possible. As Muaharrem’s sister, Ozlem, walked him through his neighborhood, he suddenly realized that everyone he encountered not only understood his language but was able to use it with him. Samsung had contracted the locals to learn sign language as a promotion for its new technology for the hard of hearing but ended up giving Muaharrem the best gift he could have gotten: the gift of communication.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.” - Leo Buscaglia

“We have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak.” – Epictetus

“For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone.” - Audrey Hepburn
