## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,122**

Each August, our RE/MAX office fundraises for the Children’s Miracle Network, which directly benefits our Phoenix Children’s Hospital. This year, on August 12th, 2022, we are hosting our annual live auction, plus a concert featuring Nashville’s newest star, Ava Paige and local talent Vedder Gabriel at the Ainsworth in downtown Phoenix. Both artists are also miracle children who have been treated at a Children’s Miracle Network hospital – Ava was diagnosed with Leukemia just before her 15th birthday and Vedder was born with Necrotizing EnteroColitis or (NEC), and the doctors gave him a 30% chance of survival.

Since 2001 we've raised close to $700,000 for the Phoenix Children's Hospital and plan to surpass that number in donation this year. Here are a few ways you can participate:

1. If you have any item or service you can donate for the live auction, let me know and we'll arrange for a pickup.&nbsp;
2. If you would like to attend the event and be one of my guests, contact me right away. Seating is limited and we do plan to sell out\!
3. If you cannot make it, but would like to donate, please click here and add my name as the "Recognition Name."&nbsp;[https://rem.ax/PCHPros2022](https://rem.ax/PCHPros2022)&nbsp;

I am very grateful for your support to help us reach our goal to help the kiddos at Phoenix Children’s Hospital\! Let's make it a great week\!
