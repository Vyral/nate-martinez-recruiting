## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,123**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you well and that you had a wonderful weekend with family and loved ones. A few weeks ago I asked you how you were doing with your goals for 2022. Did you consider where you are at today and what the remainder of the year looks like?

When you set your goals or think about your potential, so many of us base it on what we did in the past – which can be a great place to start. But what if you are where you are today, not because of what you have done, but what you didn’t do? What excuses are you using to hold yourself back from living up to your full potential? Challenge yourself to think outside the box of rules and go for it. I believe in you. Let’s make it a great week\!

PS there is still time to get your ticket to our Month of Miracles Concert Charity Extravaganza coming up on Friday, August 12th. [Click here](https://funtimesatpros.yapsody.com/event/book/736207/31453557?rmxv=1658508715) to get your tickets\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

A Creed To Live By

Don't undermine your worth by comparing yourself with others. It is because we are different that each of us is special.

Don't set your goals by what other people deem important. Only you know what is best for you.

Don't take for granted the things closest to your heart. Cling to them as you would your life, for without them life is meaningless.

Don't let your life slip through your fingers by living in the past or for the future. By living your life one day at a time, you live all the days of your life.

Don't give up when you still have something to give. Nothing is really over until the moment you stop trying.

Don't be afraid to admit that you are less than perfect. It is this fragile thread that binds us to each other.

Don't be afraid to encounter risks. It is by taking chances that we learn how to be brave.

Don't shut love out of your life by saying it's impossible to find. The quickest way to receive love is to give love. The fastest way to lose love is to hold it too tightly; and the best way to keep love is to give it wings.

Don't dismiss your dreams. To be without dreams is to be without hope; to be without hope is to be without purpose.

Don't run through life so fast that you forget not only where you've been, but also where you're going. Life is not a race, but a journey to be savored each step of the way.
