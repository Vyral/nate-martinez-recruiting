## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,124**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I was on a webinar the other day and the topic of core values came up. As a business owner, and a team leader we have spent hours over the years developing our core values. But it hit me while listening to the discussion that core values are not just for business owners or team leaders. Core values are for everyone. They are your guiding principles that represent what you stand for in life. If you have never thought about your core values, I would like to challenge you this week to carve out some time to brainstorm the words or phrases that describe the characteristics you value the most. We will continue this conversation in the next Monday Morning Message. Let’s make it a great week\!
