## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,125**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you well and enjoying the wonderful monsoon season our state is experiencing this summer\! There is nothing better than the smell of fresh rain on the desert floor\! Last week we talked about core values – how did you do? Did you take some time to work on creating or refining your core values?

This week, I’d like to give a huge shout out to those of you who attended our charity extravaganza on Friday night at The Ainsworth in downtown Phoenix. Together, we were able to fundraise over $22,000 just in the auction items that were donated thanks to our amazingly support and generous agents, family, friends and business partners. It was a special night, and we were both blessed and entertained by our two guest artists. The totals are not in yet for the Month of Miracles, but we have a hope to hit $50,000 by the end of the month\!

Our children are the future and raising money for the Phoenix Children’s Hospital is something near and dear to my heart and has been since I began my journey as a RE/MAX agent. I also want to thank my awesome team at RE/MAX Professionals. Without them, none of this would have happened – they see my vision and make it come to life – there is no way I can thank them enough for their hard work, dedication, selflessness, passion and determination\!

Without charity, we cannot make a difference in our community. Again, thank you to everyone who helped with this year’s Month of Miracles. Let’s make it a great week\!

PS We have one more fundraising event scheduled this week – we are hosting a 3 hour Disclosure continuing education class on Thursday, August 18th from 9am-12noon on Zoom. There is a $10 fee to attend, however all the money raised will go to the Month of Miracles\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

A long time ago I worked as a volunteer at a hospital. There was a little girl, who suffered from a serious disease. The only chance for her recovery was a blood transfusion from her five-year-old brother, since he had experienced the same disease and had miraculously recovered. Thus, he had the needed antibodies to struggle with this illness.

So, the doctor told about the situation to the boy and asked him, if he is willing to give his blood to his sister. He hesitated only for a moment, then the little boy took a deep breath and said, “Yes, I will do this, if it will save her life.”

During the transmission his sister was lying in bed next to him. The boy looked at her and smiled, but gradually his face became pale, and his smile faded. He asked the doctor with a trembling voice, “Will I start to die right now?”

The little boy thought that he would have to give all his blood to save the life of his beloved sister.
