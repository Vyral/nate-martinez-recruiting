## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,126**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! The other day I was chatting with a friend and our conversation went from business strategies to a more personal tone. He was vulnerable with me and shared that his mother was rather abusive when he was growing up and told him he’d never amount to anything. We discovered that for 60 years, he had been unconsciously holding onto his mother’s words and how much they were holding him back from truly living the life he envisioned. I am sharing this with you today, because I think we all have mental tapes we play that impede our growth and hold us back from living up to our potential – often times without us even realizing it – it’s just so engrained that we accept it as truth. This week, I’d like to challenge you to identify the tapes you are playing and ask yourself if they are supporting you or holding you back? You deserve the best life. Let’s make it a great week\!

We have ten more days before the Month of Miracles for 2022 comes to an end\! Would you like to support our fundraising goal to hit $50,000 this month? You make a donation online here: [https://rem.ax/PCHPros2022](https://rem.ax/PCHPros2022)

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

Puppies for Sale

A shop owner placed a sign above his door that said: “Puppies For Sale.”

Signs like this always have a way of attracting young children, and to no surprise, a boy saw the sign and approached the owner: “How much are you going to sell the puppies for?” he asked.

The store owner replied, “Anywhere from $30 to $50.”

The little boy pulled out some change from his pocket. “I have $2.37,” he said. “Can I please look at them?”

The shop owner smiled and whistled. Out of the kennel came Lady, who ran down the aisle of his shop followed by five teeny, tiny balls of fur.

One puppy was lagging considerably behind. Immediately the little boy singled out the lagging, limping puppy and said, “What’s wrong with that little dog?”

The shop owner explained that the veterinarian had examined the little puppy and had discovered it didn’t have a hip socket. It would always limp. It would always be lame.

The little boy became excited. “That is the puppy that I want to buy.”

The shop owner said, “No, you don’t want to buy that little dog. If you really want him, I’ll just give him to you.”

The little boy got quite upset. He looked straight into the store owner’s eyes, pointing his finger, and said:&nbsp; “I don’t want you to give him to me. That little dog is worth every bit as much as all the other dogs and I’ll pay full price. In fact, I’ll give you $2.37 now, and 50 cents a month until I have him paid for.”

The shop owner countered, “You really don’t want to buy this little dog. He is never going to be able to run and jump and play with you like the other puppies.”

To his surprise, the little boy reached down and rolled up his pant leg to reveal a badly twisted, crippled left leg supported by a big metal brace. He looked up at the shop owner and softly replied, “Well, I don’t run so well myself, and the little puppy will need someone who understands\!”
