## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,127**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! How was your week? Did you take some time for yourself? It’s a new week filled with amazing opportunities, so let’s get started with the Monday Morning Message\! We are getting ready to launch a series of masterminds at RE/MAX Professionals, which got me thinking about this email. Did you know that the concept of masterminding has been around since 1925 when Napoleon Hill discovered the power of peer-to-peer accountability? There is a magical phenomenon that happens when we surround ourselves with people who don’t allow us to remain mediocrity – in other words they call you on your excuses. This week, the challenge is to find someone in your life that you trust to mastermind with. If you don’t have one, call me and I’ll be there. Let’s make it a great week\!

We have three more days before the Month of Miracles for 2022 comes to an end\! Would you like to support our fundraising goal to hit $50,000 this month? You make a donation online here: [https://rem.ax/PCHPros2022](https://rem.ax/PCHPros2022)

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

Peak Performer

One of the wonderful by-products of high self-esteem is that you become a "Peak Performer."

Every day you become more aware of your abilities and recognize that opportunities to stretch your capabilities are limitless. You desire change, growth, and challenge, and a healthy self-esteem provides the energy.

Peak performers have more than goals, they have a vision of what their life will mean to themselves and others. Peak performers do not live in the future. Peak performers make sure each step taken in the present keeps them on the road toward their life goal.

Peak Performers Can Say:

I am motivated and have a mission with realistic and measurable goals.

I accept complete responsibility for everything I think, say, feel, and do.

I look for the window of opportunity in every situation and know that I will learn from every experience if I choose.

I always help others to do their best, and I encourage everyone to contribute something.

I correct my course when I reach an obstacle. This way, when things go wrong, I am still headed in the right direction.

I expect and appreciate change. It does not overwhelm me because I am prepared.

I stand up for my own opinions and values and respect others.

I am able to manage myself. I do not require instruction every step of the way.

I am not afraid of making mistakes or of taking reasonable risks.

I am my own coach. I engage in positive self-talk and rehearsal.

I am a life-long student. I am always ready to learn, and I know growth takes sustained effort.

I know myself well and still expect to find hidden talents, resources, strengths, weaknesses, energy, and interests.

I respect reality both pleasant and painful.

I engage in self-confrontation and do not blame others.

I readily forgive others and myself and correct mistakes when possible.

I am patient, kind, gentle, and compassionate with myself.

I have no need to prove I am better or worse than anybody else.
