The red-hot market has finally cooled, homes aren’t appreciating as quickly, inventory isn’t as limited, and bidding wars aren’t as common as they were two years ago. There may be a few exceptions in some pockets of the market, but for the most part, the dust has settled. As a real estate agent, what can you do to help your clients make wise real estate decisions as things change?

At 1:00 in the video, you’ll see a graph from Crawford comparing the Phoenix metro market from August 9 last year to this year. It contains critical data that can help you explain what’s truly going on in the market and convince sellers to make their real estate move.&nbsp;

As shown in the graph, inventory has increased by 155.7%, while homes under contract dropped by 29.2%. This means supply and demand have widened. **We’re now in a balanced market, and likely heading toward a buyer’s market.&nbsp;**

What does this mean for buyers? Take the time to explain to your buyer clients that this is a great opportunity for them. Interest rates have dropped and are now around 5%. The median sales price has decreased by 6.2%, and inventory is rising.
