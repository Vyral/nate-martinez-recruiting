## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,128**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope you had a great week and that you are enjoying the Labor Day weekend – it’s the first week of September\!

We wrapped up the 2022 Month of Miracles last week, and today, I wanted to share with you the grand total we were able to raise for the Phoenix Children’s Hospital - **$50,428.40\! **

This is the most RE/MAX Professionals has raised in one month, and we could not have done it without your support, your donations and your contributions. These funds will help to provide things like school supplies, pet therapies, transportation, rehabilitation, medical supplies, injections, xrays, emergency services, dialysis, NICU care, and of course the beloved red wagons that CMN hospitals have become famous for\!

On behalf of the kiddos who are treated every day at PCH, we want to thank you\! The 2022 Month of Miracles was a smashing success – thank you\! Let’s make it a great week\!
