## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,129**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! Well, we are nearing the end of the summer temps and on our way to the Q4 slide into the holiday season. Kind of crazy to think 2022 is almost over – where did the time go? Before the jingles and merriment, we need to set aside time to honestly reflect on the year and plan for 2023. I like to take inventory of what went great, what goals I hit, and identify where I can improve and grow. Goals for the next year, or maybe even the next five or ten years create clarity, purpose, and direction. When we put our goals down on paper, we cast a stone into the vast universe that has a ripple effect and that’s where the magic happens. Anything is possible because you are possible. Dare to dream bigger than ever before because this is your time. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

&nbsp;

Facts of Life:

At least 5 people in this world love you so much they would die for you.

At least 15 people in this world love you in some way.

Every night, someone thinks about you before they go to sleep.

You mean the world to someone.

Someone that you don't know even exists, loves you.

You are special and unique. You're the only you there is.

The only reason anyone would ever hate you is because they want to be just like you. No kidding\!

A smile from you can bring happiness to anyone, even if they don't like you.

When you think the world has turned its back on you, take a look; you most likely turned your back on the world.

When you make the biggest mistake ever, something good comes from it.

Always remember compliments you received and forget about the rude remarks.

Tell the people you love that you love them.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.” - Mahatma Gandhi

“You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.” - Steve Jobs

“Life itself is the most wonderful fairy tale.” - Hans Christian Andersen
