## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,130**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! As I prepare this week’s message, I am stuck at the airport in Houston on a delayed flight to my destination of Croatia to spend the next ten days with my brothers from GoBundance which is a mastermind group I belong to. Traveling can be stressful, especially traveling aboard. Delays and cancelled flights can ruin an excited, positive attitude.

But as I type this I reminded of a quote by Maya Angelou, “I've learned that no matter what happens, or how bad it seems today, life does go on, and it will be better tomorrow. I've learned that you can tell a lot about a person by the way he/she handles these three things: a rainy day, lost luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights.”

No matter what life throws at you, life goes on tomorrow. I am committed to keeping a positive attitude no matter the delays and more importantly a smile on my face for the adventure that I will eventually get to. Keep smiling. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

A ROAD TRIP WITH A RESILIENT MOUSE

Here is an adventurous trip story that takes place in Death Valley National Park, which my friends and I thought got its name because nothing lives there.

We were wrong.

While cooking dinner in the campground, one of us had an idea to open all the car doors in the evening to release the stale air inside. This didn’t turn out to be a very good idea.

The next morning, we packed everything up and got ready to discover other parts of Death Valley, when suddenly a mouse jumped on my legs\!

“Boys, we have a mouse in the car\!” I screamed.

My brother turned to me disbelievingly. “What are you talking about?\!”

I got a similar gaze from Jakub, who nervously asked, “Are you sure?”

The mouse quickly disappeared, and I was left trying to get the rest of the group to believe me.

The truth came out the next morning, though. Jakub grabbed a pack of pasta and it started to spill all over the car trunk. The mouse must have bitten a hole in it. Now they believed me, and we set off on a mission to rid the mouse from the car.

Our first plan was to download a number of mobile apps producing squeaky anti-mouse sounds. In the evening, we opened everything possible and turned on our phones to maximum volume. After a while, we were going crazy due to this terrible sound. The mouse, on the other hand, didn’t mind at all and, I can only imagine, quietly laughed at us.

In the morning, we found more mouse damage — a leaking barrel of water had soaked half of our things, and the mouse had eaten through my headphones. Plus, we were starting to worry about the car’s electricity.

We decided our next step was to go to Walmart for traps. Before heading to bed we carefully filled the traps with cheese and spread them evenly throughout the car, eager to see if we captured the mouse by morning. Unfortunately, when we woke up they were empty — and we found more holes in our packed food. There was pasta everywhere\!

It was clear that if there was enough food in the car, the traps wouldn’t be interesting for her.

On the other hand, we understood the mouse. She probably hadn’t seen that much food in her entire life in Death Valley and suddenly there was this huge banquet\! What mouse wouldn’t want to explore such a rodent paradise?

She traveled with us over 600 miles before we got to Yosemite National Park. This journey brought new hope to our struggle. Bears rob 130 cars a year in Yosemite, so there are bear boxes in every campground. It was our last hope. If it didn’t work, nothing would.

We set up the traps and went to sleep, and in the morning there she was, one of the fattest mice we’d ever seen. We agreed that’d she’d probably just had the most amazing “all-inclusive trip” of her life.
