## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,131**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you well and ready for the new week…while it might not feel like it just yet, we can still say welcome fall as we celebrate the official first week\! Before we know, we will forget about the scorching sun and find ourselves once again reminded by the beautiful fall weather, why we tolerate the hot Arizona summers. Before the triple digits say goodbye, I’d like to challenge you to celebrate the changing season with all your favorite summer activities. Fall in Arizona looks a little different than the rest of the country so be sure to savor every minute of your favorite Arizona activities. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

“When I was working at Hobby Lobby during the Christmas season, I was sick and had almost lost my voice, but kept my attitude very upbeat. It was almost at the end of the night when this elderly couple came through my line. We started joking about them going to Cracker Barrel and the man asked me what I wanted. I joked about meatloaf and green beans with a sweet tea. About 20 minutes later, the elderly couple came back into the store with a bag from Cracker Barrel with my exact order, down to the sweet tea. The lady whispered, ‘Merry Christmas’ to me and I literally cried right there in the store.”
