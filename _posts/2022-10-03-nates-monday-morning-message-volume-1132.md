## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,132**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you well and refreshed for a new week. Today I want to talk about mindset. There are those out there who talk about having motivation, but let’s be real – motivation comes and goes as it pleases. Some days motivation is on fire, then the next day, it vanishes into thin air. But mindset on the other hand, its always there. And it’s a strong, positive, determined mindset that pushes us towards the activities required to achieve our goals. Its mindset that creates discipline, and discipline will accomplish more than motivation alone could ever do. Mindset will overcome any obstacles put in your path to success. Mindset will determine if you win at the game of life. This week, reconnect with a mindset that will lead you to the life you’ve always dreamed of. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

The Crow and the Pitcher

A Crow, half-dead with thirst, came upon a Pitcher which had once been full of water; but when the Crow put its beak into the mouth of the Pitcher, he found that only very little water was left in it, and that he could not reach far enough down to get at it. He tried, and he tried, but at last had to give up in despair. Then a thought came to him, and he took a pebble and dropped it into the Pitcher. Then he took another pebble and dropped it into the Pitcher. Then he took another pebble and dropped that into the Pitcher. Then he took another pebble and dropped that into the Pitcher. Then he took another pebble and dropped that into the Pitcher. Then he took another pebble and dropped that into the Pitcher. At last, at last, he saw the water mount up near him, and after casting in a few more pebbles he was able to quench his thirst and save his life.

Moral: Little by little does the trick.
