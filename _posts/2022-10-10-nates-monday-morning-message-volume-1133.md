## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,133**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! Today I want to talk about the three ingredients for influencing the conversations we have with those we care about. Those are curiosity, empathy, and courage. I love the simplicity of this concept, yet it is something missing in most conversations. To truly listen and connect, these three ingredients are essential. To come from a place of curiosity means we are open to hearing what the other person has to say. Empathy allows us to feel what the other person is experiencing, and courage creates trust and respect. This week, I’d like to challenge you to apply these three ingredients in the conversations you have with your loved one. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

George was a driver and he spent so much time at his work, that he could hardly have a meal together with his wife and three children. In the evenings he attended classes, seeking to get knowledge, that one day would help him to find a better paying job.

George‘s family often complained that he is not spending enough time with them, but his only answer was “I am doing all this for you, I work hard to provide my family with the best that I can.“

Soon after George had passed his exams, he received a good job offer with a salary, which was significantly higher than he had before. So now George could provide his family with more expensive clothes, some luxury items or vacations in foreign countries. It was like a dream come true, but family still did not get enough attention from George, as he continued to work very hard and often he did not get to see his family for most of the week.

Time passed and George‘s hard work paid off, he was promoted. He decided to relieve his wife from domestic works, so he hired a maid. He also decided that their flat is not big enough for their family and they need a more spacious one. He needed to work even harder and, moreover, he continued his studies, so that he would be promoted again. George worked so hard, that sometimes he even had to spend his Sundays with his clients instead of his wife and children. And again, whenever family asked for his time and complained that they do not spend enough time together, he answered, that he was doing all this only for them.

A bit later George was promoted, so he could buy a spacious house with a beautiful view. On the first Sunday evening at their new home, George told his wife and kids, that now he decided not to take any studies and work not so hard, so that he could spend more time with his beloved family. The very next morning George did not wake up.
