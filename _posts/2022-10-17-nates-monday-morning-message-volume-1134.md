## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,134**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you ready to embrace the new week ahead\! Today, I want to ask you a question today: what is your best investment? When I ask this question, people typically tell me that is their best investment is a real estate transaction, or a stock investment. While those are great investments, the best investment you can make is in yourself. The time and energy you invest in training, coaching, reading, exercising, etc. will have the most positive impact in your life, and will help you achieve your goals.

This week, I’d like to challenge you to ask yourself: to have the life and business you want, and to do the things you want to do, who do you have to become? I believe its really important to think about this question and have an honest conversation with yourself. Before you can achieve success, you have to be wiling to do the work required to get there. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

**Choices**

There comes a time in your life, when you must decide,

No help from anyone, on which you've always relied.

Between right and wrong, between black and white,

Between good and bad, to walk away or fight.

To be honest and true. to be open with your heart, Or to hide your feelings, play it safe from the start.

To sit back and watch, to listen and learn, Or jump into the fire, taking a chance on a burn.

To stay. to move. to not care, or always prove.

To be strong, to be weak, to be aggressive, to be meek.

To laugh out loud with all your might, or smile a little just to be polite.

To stay together. to live apart. to think with your mind, or trust your with heart.

To live in the past. to always look back, to look ahead to the future, with ambition you won't lack.

Begun at the front. or start at the end, believe in your own self, or follow the trend.

To dream. to hope, to quit, to cope. To be a lover, to be a friend to be real, or just pretend.

Choices we make can make or break, to have to decide at all could be our worst fall.

Choices are sometimes deceiving, you can be lured by the sweetest bait.

So make your decision wisely, because to change your mind could be too late.

Life is about choices, for however we decide,We'll have to live with our decision until the day we have died.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“You know, sometimes all you need is 20 seconds of insane courage. Just, literally, 20 seconds of just embarrassing bravery. And I promise you, something great will come of it.” – Benjamin Mee

“Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.” - Steve Jobs

“It is our choices... that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.” - J. K. Rowling
