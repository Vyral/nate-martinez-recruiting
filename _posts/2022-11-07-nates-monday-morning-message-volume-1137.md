## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,137**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! It’s that time of year – its time to start planning for 2023\! There are many things you can include in your plan, but here are the three basics every plan must have:&nbsp;

1\. A mission or vision statement. This is self-explanatory, but it should include who you are, why you exist, and what you want to achieve. Ask yourself what your purpose is, what you value, and what kind of person you want to be known for.

2\. Your strengths and weaknesses. Knowing these will help you stay aware and know what to work on to improve. The easiest way to do this is to perform a SWOT analysis, which stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Remember, that a threat or a weakness can be turned into an opportunity.

3\. Your goals. Too many people choose goals that are unattainable or not specific enough to achieve. The best way to create a good goal is to make it SMART, which stands for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.&nbsp;

Once you’re done, make sure you create a schedule for when you’re going to reevaluate and do so regularly. Things change—that’s life\! Make sure you’re ready to move with the times. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

Two travelers went to the mountains. When they crossed the half-way already, the beginner looked at the undergrowth and began to lament:

“But where is the beautiful scenery, which you were talking about all the time?”

His experienced companion smiled and answered:

“You’re in the center of it. You will see it, when we reach the top of the mountain.”
