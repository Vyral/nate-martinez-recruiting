## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,138**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! This week I wanted to share that our partners at Motto Mortgage Pros are hosting a food drive throughout the month of November. It’s a part of their Mission Against Hunger and all donations will go to support St. Mary’s Food Bank in the Valley. Arizona has a food insecurity rate of 16.4% for children, which ranks \#12 in the U.S. One in every seven people in Arizona struggle with food insecurity – our children, seniors and rural families are at the greatest risk. We would love to have your support this year\! You can drop off a donation at any one of our three office locations until November 30th. We appreciate your help and so do those who are in need. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

**Hannah Taylor –&nbsp;[The Ladybug Foundation](http://www.ladybugfoundation.ca/){: target="_blank"}**\:

When she was 5-years-old, Hannah Taylor saw a homeless man eating out of a garbage can on a cold winter day. For the next year she constantly asked her parents: “Why? Why couldn’t everyone just share what they have to end homelessness?”. At age 8, Hannah founded The Ladybug Foundation which has raised over 3 million dollars to fight homelessness in Canada. Hannah is also the founder of a second, separate charity, The Ladybug Foundation Education Program Inc., through which she created “makeChange: The Ladybug Foundation Education Program”, a K-12 resource for use in schools across Canada to empower young people to get involved and “makeChange” in their world.
