## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,139**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! Today, I want to focus this message on gratitude, as we prepare for the Thanksgiving Day celebration. We can be grateful for specifics, but in reality gratitude is a state of being. It is impossible to be angry or scared or sad when gratitude is present. I know that the holiday season can be stressful for many, so I’d like to remind you that gratitude is a great way to manage the stress and anxiety. There is so much to be grateful for, and I am grateful for each of you who take the time to read this message every Monday. I am grateful for my team, the clients we serve, the agents and crew at RE/MAX Professionals, and my family. Without them, I would not be the man I am today. Happy Thanksgiving\! Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

The Harvest Moon by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

It is the Harvest Moon\! On gilded vanesAnd roofs of villages, on woodland crestsAnd their aerial neighborhoods of nestsDeserted, on the curtained window-panesOf rooms where children sleep, on country lanesAnd harvest-fields, its mystic splendor rests\!Gone are the birds that were our summer guests,With the last sheaves return the laboring wains\!All things are symbols: the external showsOf Nature have their image in the mind,As flowers and fruits and falling of the leaves;The song-birds leave us at the summer's close,Only the empty nests are left behind,And pipings of the quail among the sheaves.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Gratitude is the inward feeling of kindness received. Thankfulness is the natural impulse to express that feeling. Thanksgiving is the following of that impulse.” - Henry Van Dyke

“Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings.” - William Arthur Ward

“To give thanks in solitude is enough. Thanksgiving has wings and goes where it must go. Your prayer knows much more about it than you do.” - Victor Hugo
