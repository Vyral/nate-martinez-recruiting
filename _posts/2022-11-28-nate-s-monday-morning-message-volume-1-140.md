## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,140**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope that each of you reading this had a wonderful holiday weekend and that you are filled with gratitude. The holiday season has officially begun leaving us with just 33 days left in 2022 which means every second counts. Before you jump into the merriment, I’d like to encourage you to slow down; maybe say no to something you don’t really want to do. Be more present in your conversations and activities. And trust that there is beauty in the imperfections. Let’s make it a great week\!
