## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,141**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope this email finds you in good spirits and enjoying the holiday season so far. Today I want to talk about action. The word “act” means to do something; to aim for a result. Taking action can do more than produce results – it can change a state of mind, it can save a life, it can make a new relationship. When opportunity presents itself to us, our obligation is to take action. This week I’d like to challenge you to decide what is one thing you can take action on – even if its only baby steps – action duplicated creates results. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

When the supermarket clerk tallied up my groceries, I was $12 over what I had on me. I began to remove items from the bags, when another shopper handed me a $20 bill. “Please don’t put yourself out,” I told him. “Let me tell you a story,” he said. “My mother is in the hospital with cancer. I visit her every day and bring her flowers. I went this morning, and she got mad at me for spending my money on more flowers. She demanded that I do something else with that money. So, here, please accept this. It is my mother’s flowers.” – Leslie Wagner, Peel, Arkansas.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“You know, sometimes all you need is twenty seconds of insane courage. Just literally twenty seconds of just embarrassing bravery. And I promise you, something great will come of it.” - Benjamin Mee, We Bought a Zoo

“Infuse your life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. Make your own love. And whatever your beliefs, honor your creator, not by passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high, but by doing what you can to make grace happen... yourself, right now, right down here on Earth.” - Bradley Whitford

“Action is the foundational key to all success.” - Pablo Picasso
