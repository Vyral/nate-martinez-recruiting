## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,142**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I shared this on my Facebook page a few days ago so I thought I would share it with you today. “Call me crazy but I like to see other people happy and succeeding. Life is a journey, not a competition.” When we champion those around us, we actually make room for more of our own happiness and success. Instead of feeling jealous or resentful, be inspired and motivated by those around you who are crushing it. Life can be a challenge, and the more love, support and kindness we can spread, the better it will be for all of us. Let’s make it a great week\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

How to Hunt a Monkey

“Do you know how hunters of old used to trap monkeys?” A man asked his child.

“Rather than chasing them up a tree or shooting arrows from below, they’d put a heavy glass jar with a narrow neck on the floor, which had the monkeys’ favorite food inside.

They’d then step back and hide, waiting for the unsuspecting animal to approach.

When it did, the monkey would reach inside, clench a fist around the food, and try to pull it out. However, the narrow neck of the jar would stop the poor monkey from getting its hand out\!

It would pull and pull, but to no avail. There was simply no way to get its hand out of the jar without releasing the food.

Rather than letting go, though, the monkey would persevere, refusing to drop its dinner.

The hunters would then approach and catch it to enjoy a meal of their own.”

“Don’t be like that monkey,” warned the man, “In life, to fight another day and grow as person, you must know when to quit, when to move on, and when to let go of whatever’s holding you back.”
