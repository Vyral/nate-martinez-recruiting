Poem About A Successful Year Ahead by Sumira R. Arain

First day of the New Year.<br>It's time to shine for a new day.<br>Forget your past,Your sorrow, your pain.<br>New ideas are waiting ahead.<br>It's time to recall all your memories,<br>Beautiful dreams that remain uncovered,<br>Painful parts of life when your heart gets crushed.<br>But don't be afraid.<br>The future is in your hand.<br>Hold it in your hand.<br>Start your race,<br>A new journey,<br>That leads you to success.<br>You will rise again<br>You will shine again.<br>Happy New Year\!

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“And now we welcome the new year. Full of things that have never been.” - Rainer Maria Rilke

“New Year's Day. A fresh start. A new chapter in life waiting to be written. New questions to be asked, embraced, and loved. Answers to be discovered and then lived in this transformative year of delight and self-discovery. Today carve out a quiet interlude for yourself in which to dream, pen in hand. Only dreams give birth to change.” - Sarah Ban Breathnach

“Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson
