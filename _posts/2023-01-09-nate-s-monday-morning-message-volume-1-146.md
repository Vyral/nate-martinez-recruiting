## **Nate’s Monday Morning Message<br>Volume 1,146**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message\! I hope the first week of the New Year has been a great start for you. We are back in full swing\! I came across this short story the other day, and while I have shared it before I thought it was timely to share again. Its so easy to draw quick conclusions before we have all the facts. We are taught at a young age what is good or bad, pretty or ugly, acceptable, not acceptable. I am not sure if I believe in luck but what I do know for certain, is that consistent commitment will always win – there is no luck needed when we stay focused on the desired outcome. Let’s make it a great week\!

PS You are invited\! We are hosting a 90-minute event - 8 Ways to Dominate Any Real Estate Market - which includes a free margarita happy hour. If you are afraid the real estate market is going to plummet, you don't want to miss this event\!&nbsp;[Click here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/601446813632661)&nbsp;to RSVP - seating is limited\!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

A farmer and his son had a beloved stallion who helped the family earn a living. One day, the horse ran away, and their neighbors said, “Your horse ran away, what terrible luck\!” The farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not. We’ll see.”&nbsp;

A few days later the horse returned home, leading a few wild mares back to the farm as well. The neighbors shouted out “Your horse has returned and brought several horses home with him. What great luck\!” and the farmer replied “Maybe so, maybe not. We’ll see.”&nbsp;

Later in the week, the farmer’s son was trying to break one of the mares and she threw him to the ground, breaking his leg. The villagers cried “Your son broke his leg, what terrible luck\!”. The farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not. We’ll see.”&nbsp;

A few weeks later, soldiers from the national army marched through town, recruiting all the able-bodied young men for the army. The farmer’s son wasn’t selected, because he was still recovering from his injury. His neighbors shouted, “Your boy is spared, what tremendous luck\!” to which the farmer replied “Maybe so, maybe not. We’ll see."&nbsp;

The moral of this story is that very few events can truly be judged as good or bad, lucky or unlucky, fortunate or unfortunate at the time that they occur – in many cases only time will tell the whole story. All too often (like the farmer’s neighbors) we’re tempted to get way too excited when things look fantastic on the surface but that may not be great in the end; more frequently, we can go into panic mode over things that don’t go our way.&nbsp;

“The only limit to your impact is your imagination and commitment.” - Tony Robbins

“It was character that got us out of bed, commitment that moved us into action, and discipline that enabled us to follow through.” - Zig Ziglar
