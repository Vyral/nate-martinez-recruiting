**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,148**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! If you are like me, you might have spent some time this weekend watching football. It’s the playoffs and every game counts. In football playoffs, there is not a five-game series, there are no rematches. There is no opportunity to build up momentum. It comes down to who is the best team that day – its win or go home. That got me thinking about life and how we show up every day. Do we treat today like a regular season game, or do we show up like it’s the game that determines if we make it to the Superbowl?

This week, I’d like to challenge you to show up like it’s the playoffs – play each day as if it’s the last game. Show up and win like the champion you are. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

He was a man of flesh and blood. He wasn't made of rock.<br>Angel, devil, child, - man of ordinary stock.<br>But somehow he was different - true athletes always are-<br>For as he cursed, sweated, and bled, he took pride in the scar.&nbsp;

​They told him to win like a man, no matter what the cost;<br>So many times he ventured forth; so many times he lost.<br>And when they turned around and said, "It's OK son, you tried,"<br>He clenched his headgear in his fist, and like a man he cried.

But from his tears came anger; then, when it ceased to spin,<br>He rose again, determined that next time he would win.<br>His trembling body strengthened; his heart soared in sky.<br>His darkened soul stood flaming; there was fire in his eye.<br>He worked and worked relentlessly; he struggled and he strained.<br>His conscience whipped him mercilessly for every ounce he gained.

He ran on legs like pistons; his muscled arms grew sore;<br>He'd tell himself, "I have to" then ask himself, "What for?"

And then, at last, the reckoning: the final hour was here,<br>His stomach tightened dangerously, his muscles tensed with fear.<br>Weak-kneed, he shook the challenger's hand-<br>And then, as one possessed,<br>His instincts gave him power, and his body did the rest.&nbsp;

​​​​​It suddenly was ended. His body seemed to scatter.<br>A crowd was cheering somewhere, but to him it did not matter.<br>One thought was gleaming in his brain, a thought that made him smile.

He's given it all he had, and that's what made it all worthwhile<br>He stood and faced his teammates, with pride instead of shame.<br>He knew not that he'd won or lost, but that he'd played the game.

And some call him THE WRESTLER, and some call him A MAN,<br>But he called himself a WINNER...And the ref held up his hand.
