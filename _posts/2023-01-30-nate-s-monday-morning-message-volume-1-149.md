**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,149**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I was listening to Tony Robbins the other day &nbsp;and he said something that I want to share with you today. “Massive action is the cure all.” He went on to say that so often we focus all our attention on what we didn’t do, instead of what actually did do. The only way life changes is by taking massive action. I thought about some of the big moves I have made in my life – like opening our first office location on 9/11 – all those big decisions or massive action I took came from a deep, incurable hunger for a better life. This week I’d like to challenge you to commit to one big step you can take that will help you get to the life you deserve. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

The Value of Money (Inspiring Short Story about Self-Worth)

At the beginning of a new school year, a class teacher stands up in front of her students holding a $100 bill.

She tells them, “Put your hands up if you want this money.”

Every hand in the room goes up, to which the teacher says, “I am going to give this money to someone here, but first, let me do this…”

She takes the bill and crumples it up in her hands, before asking, “Who still wants it?”

The hands stay up.

The teacher then drops the bill on the floor, stomps and grinds it into the ground, and picks it back up. “How about now?” she asks again.

The hands stay up.

“Class, I hope you see the lesson here. It didn’t matter what I did to this money, you still wanted it because its value stayed the same. Even with its creases and dirtiness, it’s still worth $100.”

She continues, “It’s the same with us. There will be similar times in your life when you’re dropped, bruised, and muddied. Yet no matter what happens, you *never* lose your value.”

**Moral of the story:**

Life’s hardships are inevitable and we’ll all be put through the ringer at some point, often through no fault of our own.

Don’t let these challenges alter your feelings of self-worth. You’ll always be enough; you have something unique and special to give and offer the world.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.” - Dale Carnegie

“Action is the foundational key to all success.” - Pablo Picasso

“Once we start to act, hope is everywhere. So instead of looking for hope, look for action. Then, and only then, hope will come.” - Greta Thunburg
