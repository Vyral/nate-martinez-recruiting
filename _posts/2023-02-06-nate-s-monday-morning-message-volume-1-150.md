**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,150**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well, rested, and ready for the new week. Last week I talked about taking massive action, and this week I want to continue that thought. Some times our goals and dreams require us to dig deep and take a leap of faith – massive action. However, there are also times that something simple, but done with consistency will create a compound effect that turns out massive over time. Don’t be overwhelmed by the big details. Instead, find one thing you can commit to this week, that if you commit to it daily it will make an impact. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

The Story of the Grateful Starfishes (Inspiring Story about Attitude)

One morning, an elderly man was walking along the beach when he noticed a young boy picking something off the sand and throwing it into the sea.

As he got closer, the man realized the child was throwing stranded starfishes that had washed up on the shore back into the breaking waves.

Approaching the boy, the man asked what he was doing.

“The starfish will die if they’re still on the shore when the sun rises,” he replied.

Perplexed, the old man said, “But that’s pointless! There are countless miles of beach and thousands of starfish. It doesn’t matter how many you return to the water, you can’t make a difference.”

Unfazed, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish, and tossed it into the sea.

“It matters to this one,” he said.

**Moral of the story:**

No matter the odds of success or the scale of the challenge, your actions can make a difference. It’s better to light a candle than curse the dark.

Every little thing counts. Doing something to make a positive change is always better than nothing!

“Ideas pull the trigger, but instinct loads the gun.” - Don Marquis

“Do more than is required. What is the distance between someone who achieves their goals consistently and those who spend their lives and careers merely following? The extra mile.” - Gary Ryan Blair
