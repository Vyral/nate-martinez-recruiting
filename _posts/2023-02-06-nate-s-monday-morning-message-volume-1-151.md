**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,151**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! What a week it has been in the Valley of the Sun! I am sure some of you reading this are grateful we made it through one of the busiest week’s maybe ever in Phoenix. As things return to normal, we have a new week ahead of us and a week dedicated to St Valentine. It’s a day to celebrate your romantic relationships and appreciate what it means to love. I hope you will take a moment to show love to those you care about but also pass some along to a stranger with a kind smile, an open door, a random gesture meant with no strings attached. To quote the great John Lennon, “love is all you need.” Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

“Sonnet 18” by Williams Shakespeare

Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?

Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,

And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,

And often is his gold complexion dimmed;

And every fair from fair sometime declines,

By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;

But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,

Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,

When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.

So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,

So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“The heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing.” - Blaise Pascal

“For it was not into my ear you whispered, but into my heart. It was not my lips you kissed, but my soul.” - Judy Garland

“Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone - we find it with another.” - Thomas Merton
