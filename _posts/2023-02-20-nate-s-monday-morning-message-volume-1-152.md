**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,152**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! Some of you reading this are enjoying the last of a three day weekend – and today we remember those great men who held the title as President. It takes courage and determination to be the leader of the free world and without those men who forged forward to do the right thing, we may have had a very different outcome. Today as you enjoy an extra day off, I hope you’ll take moment to say thank you. Happy President’s Day! Let’s make it a great week!
