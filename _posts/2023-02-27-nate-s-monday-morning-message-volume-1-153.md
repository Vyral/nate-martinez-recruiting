**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,153**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! My team and I are headed to Las Vegas for the annual RE/MAX Convention, which happens to be the 50th anniversary! I have been to every R4 convention since becoming a part of this worldwide franchise – because I believe in the power of education and networking among giants. That has inspired today’s message – education. I can remember going to my first real estate class and opting to sit in the front row so I wouldn’t miss a thing (I still sit in the front row 37 years later!).

The brain is a muscle and if it doesn’t get used (or exercised), just like any other muscle in the body, it gets weak over time. Education makes us better at our skill. Education creates clarity and gives us direction. Education is power. This week, I’d like to challenge you to learn one new thing that will make your life better. I’d love to hear from you – hit me back with what it is you are going to learn. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

The Value of Money (Inspiring Short Story about Self-Worth)

At the beginning of a new school year, a class teacher stands up in front of her students holding a $100 bill.

She tells them, “Put your hands up if you want this money”.

Every hand in the room goes up, to which the teacher says, “I am going to give this money to someone here, but first, let me do this…”

She takes the bill and crumples it up in her hands, before asking, “Who still wants it?”

The hands stay up.

The teacher then drops the bill on the floor, stomps and grinds it into the ground, and picks it back up. “How about now?” she asks again.

The hands stay up.

“Class, I hope you see the lesson here. It didn’t matter what I did to this money, you still wanted it because its value stayed the same. Even with its creases and dirtiness, it’s still worth $100.”

She continues, “It’s the same with us. There will be similar times in your life when you’re dropped, bruised, and muddied. Yet no matter what happens, you *never* lose your value.”

**Moral of the story:**

Life’s hardships are inevitable and we’ll all be put through the ringer at some point, often through no fault of our own.

Don’t let these challenges alter your feelings of self-worth. You’ll always be enough; you have something unique and special to give and offer the world.
