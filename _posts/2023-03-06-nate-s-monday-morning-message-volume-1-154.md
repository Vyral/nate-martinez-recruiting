**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,154**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I was listening to an interview on the radio the other day with a very popular rockstar – he shared how hard it was in the beginning of their career as a band, how no one in the business liked their style and only a handful of people showed up for their first concert. He said two things that stuck out to me – first, he said that “obstacle are what you see when you lose sight of the goal.” And that “you can’t have a plan B” which I interrupted as be all in with unwavering faith, or not at all – there is no other option. Life can be scary – the obstacles we see can be overwhelming but if you are crystal clear and have ultimate conviction – anything is possible. We were not put on this earth to play small. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

Steven Spielberg was rejected by the USC School of Cinematic Arts twice. He later went on to be nominated for 17 Oscars.

Halle Berry moved to New York when she was 18 and had to live in a homeless shelter. Years later, she became the first and only black woman to win the Oscar for Best Lead Actress.

R. H. Macy opened four different stores, which all failed, before he finally moved to New York and opened what's now known as Macy's.

J.K. Rowling was on welfare when her first Harry Potter book was rejected by 12 publishers. She's since become the world's first billion-dollar author.

Walt Disney was fired from his first animation job at a newspaper because he "lacked imagination and had no good ideas." He later went on to win the most Academy Awards of any individual.

Vincent van Gogh only sold one painting while he was alive – he didn't become successful until after his death.

Sylvester Stallone was once so poor that he sold his beloved dog for $40 so he could buy food. Years later, he sold the script for Rocky, which brought him two Oscar nominations.

Chris Pratt was homeless and lived in a van in Maui when he was 19. Almost 20 years later, he returned to Hawaii and was paid $10 million to film Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.

Stephen King's first novel, Carrie, was rejected over 30 times before it was published.

Oprah Winfrey was fired from a co-anchor position when she was 23 and was told she was "unfit for television news." We all know what happened after that.

“Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.” - Golda Meir

“Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.” - Winston Churchill

“It's easy to have faith in yourself and have discipline when you're a winner, when you're number one. What you got to have is faith and discipline when you're not a winner.” - Vince Lombardi
