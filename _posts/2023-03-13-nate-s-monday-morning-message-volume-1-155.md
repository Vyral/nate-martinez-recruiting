**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,155**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! Tomorrow is national Pi Day – did you know that an Ancient Greek mathematician named Archimedes is the most commonly credited with discovering the estimated value of pi? It’s been a holiday since 2009 (it’s also Albert Einstein’s birthday!), and a day to recognize the mathematical constant – and endless decimal representation used in the measurement of a circle, whose first three digits are 3.14 – its continues on to infinity, meaning that the “pi-ssibilities” are endless! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

Happy birthday to Albert Einstein – here is three major inventions derived from Einstein's discoveries for the modern world: &nbsp;

**1\.****Satnavs and Google Maps****\:** It's hard to get lost these days because of GPS - it's what allows our satnavs (satellite navigation systems) and smartphone map apps to tell us the quickest route to the restaurant or the beach.

But if it weren't for Einstein's general theory of relativity, we wouldn't know to take relativity's effects into account when synchronizing the network of Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites orbiting the Earth.

This fact means their data would be filled with errors, making GPS more or less useless.

**2\.****Your phone's clock****\:** Most ISPs and mobile phone masts use GPS to set the time. And with each GPS satellite containing several atomic clocks, the clocks on your computer and mobile phone are ultra-accurate.

Without that accuracy, you'd probably be late (or early) for every meeting.

There's more.

**3\.****Lasers****\:** What makes a supermarket's doors open automatically as you approach? Why do home security systems alert you to the presence of an intruder? How do smoke alarms detect fires?

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.” - Albert Einstein

“Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning.” - Albert Einstein

“Once we accept our limits, we go beyond them.” - Albert Einstein
