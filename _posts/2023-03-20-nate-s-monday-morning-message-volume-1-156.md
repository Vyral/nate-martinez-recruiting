**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,156**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! Welcome to spring 2023 – one of two times throughout the year when the sun is exactly above the Equator, making the day equal length to the night. The first day of spring represents renewal and growth – your new ideas and dreams are ready to spring to life. The chilly mornings bring on the warmth of the spring sun, which has the power to make you feel hope and inspiration. As we end Q1, its time to reflect on the year so far, then revise, recommit and reenergize. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

A Light Exists in Spring, written by Emily Dickinson

A Light exists in Spring<br>Not present on the Year<br>At any other period —<br>When March is scarcely here

A Color stands abroad<br>On Solitary Fields<br>That Science cannot overtake<br>But Human Nature feels.

It waits upon the Lawn,<br>It shows the furthest Tree<br>Upon the furthest Slope you know<br>It almost speaks to you.

Then as Horizons step<br>Or Noons report away<br>Without the Formula of sound<br>It passes and we stay —

A quality of loss<br>Affecting our Content<br>As Trade had suddenly encroached<br>Upon a Sacrament.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

**“**Spring is nature's way of saying, 'Let's party!'” - Robin Williams

“Never cut a tree down in the wintertime. Never make a negative decision in the low time. Never make your most important decisions when you are in your worst moods. Wait. Be patient. The storm will pass. The spring will come.” - Robert H. Schuller

“In winter, I plot and plan. In spring, I move.” - Henry Rollins
