**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,157**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! Over the weekend I had the privilege of golfing with family and friends at the Sand Hallow Golf Resort in Utah. While it was a bit cold for this AZ boy, it was an incredible time on a beautiful course. Years ago, I committed to playing more golf but didn’t really have a plan on how I would play more golf. My great mentor, Howard Brinton (continue to rest in peace, my friend) told me the best way to increase my golfing time was to track it. Now, it’s on my calendar every Friday – I don’t always play every Friday but its on my calendar so I can track it.

There are three things I want you to take away from today’s message. One, spending time with family and friends is important. Two, having down time is critical for our physical and mental health. Three, if you want to improve something in your life, you have to track it because, as Peter Drucker says, “what gets measured, gets done.” Let’s make it a great week!

PS Tomorrow is the day! We are hosting a 8 Ways to Dominate Any Real Estate Market Masterclass on March 28th in Peoria - and you are invited.

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

Playing in the English Amateur Championship of 1974 at Moortown Golf Club in Leeds, Nigel Denham was a little bold, and a touch left, with his approach shot to the 18th hole. His ball bounced off a path and flew through an open door at the side of the clubhouse.

At that time the clubhouse was not deemed out of bounds so Denham went to look for his ball. He just followed the shouts, as it had ricocheted off a wall and into the bar, where it had come to rest under a table. With numerous drinkers egging him on, Denham looked at the situation and wondered if a shot might be possible. He moved the table and chairs and saw he could make a swing. He opened one of the windows overlooking the 18th green and played a delicate chip off the carpet, his ball snuck through the window and landed on the green. It rolled up to within five feet of the hole and, of course, he holed the putt for a miraculous par four.
