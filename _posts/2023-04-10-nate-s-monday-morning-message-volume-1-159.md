**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,159**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope you had a lovely Easter celebration with your family and friends. It is always a great day to gather and be mindful of the wonderful gifts we have all around us.&nbsp;

As many of you know, our office has been great supporters of our local Children's Miracle Hospital and each year we donate through our commissions, as well as fundraising events in the Month of Miracles. We are very proud to know that our contributions have helped to fund the two new locations under construction in both Glendale and Avondale. I am sharing their newest Faces of Hope video below - this is a true story about a boy treated at Phoenix Children's. His journey, is why we do what we do to support PCH - and we don't have to wait for a big event or a closing to give - we can&nbsp;[help](https://rem.ax/PCHPros2022)&nbsp;anytime.

Let’s make it a great week!&nbsp;

PS You might want to grab a tissue before you hit play.&nbsp;
