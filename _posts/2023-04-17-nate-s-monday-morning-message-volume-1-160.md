**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,160**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I had the privilege of spending the day with my long-time industry friend, Verl Workman last week - he shared his time, energy and passion with a crowd of REALTORS who are embracing a new type of real estate market. It was an incredible day (those of you reading this who were there probably agree!). The theme of his talk was a statement that has hit me hard – greatness is predictable. What he means is that by focusing on the right activities, you can predict the outcome. It all boils down to one thing: action. To live a life of your dreams, you have to show up and take massive action towards it. Greatness can be predicted, if you focus on the right activities. Let’s make it a great week!&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

The Pursuit of Happiness

There was once a group of 100 people attending a seminar on personal development.

In the middle of their talk, the speaker stops and decides to run an impromptu group activity. He hands out a balloon to each attendee and tells them to write their name on it.

The balloons are then collected and placed in an adjacent room.

The speaker then instructs the 100 attendees to enter that room and, within 5 short minutes, find the balloon with their name on it.

Pandemonium breaks loose as they charge in, pushing and colliding with each other as they desperately search for their name.

The 5 minutes pass and nobody succeeds.

The speaker then tells each person to pick up any random balloon and give it the person whose name is written on it. Within a few minutes everyone has their balloon back.

He then said, “What just happened with those balloons is exactly what happens in our search for happiness. We frantically look for it all around us, not knowing where it is.”

“Yet our happiness lies in the happiness of others. By giving them their happiness, you get yours.”

**Moral of the story****\:**

Happiness and fulfilment rarely come from selfish pursuits, but almost *always* come from doing good deeds for others. By helping others, we help ourselves.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.” - Mahatma Gandhi

“Nothing great in the world has ever been accomplished without passion.” - Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel

“Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.” - Dale Carnegie
