Getting more listings is a necessary skill if you want to make more money in this industry. However, it's a lot harder to do as inventory continues to be at a record low. Even the best agents are struggling to find ways to achieve this goal and sometimes find themselves head-to-head with other real estate professionals to win the limited listings available in the market. If you want to ensure you can come out on top despite these challenges, what can you do? If you want to secure more listings, here are three things that you can do:

**1\. Leverage available resources.** The top agents are resourceful and know the best ways to utilize the tools that are available to them. Whether it’s making use of social media, blogs, or videos to boost your marketing campaigns, or capitalizing on lead generation platforms and CRMs to generate and nurture leads, you have to learn how to make these resources work for you. Keep yourself in the loop with the latest trends and be open to innovation.

**2\. Focus on your strengths.** Every agent wants to claim they can make the most money for their prospects to convince them to list. If you want to set yourself apart, you’ll have to advertise yourself differently. Play to your strengths, and tweak your pitch so that it addresses their needs. For example, if your prospect’s real estate is in the niche that you specialize in, let them know. If they need someone to stage their home and you previously had a client whose property sold on the market because of your staging skills, highlight how you can do the same for them.

**3\. Join a team.** Being on a team will help you get more listings, especially if you’re a new agent. You can network with them, and they can provide you with leads to give you that leg up. You can have access to resources that otherwise would have been unavailable to you. It also allows you to learn from more experienced members. Your team’s listing specialist can teach you the strategies they use for success that you can integrate into your own business.

We may be in a competitive market, but by applying the right strategies, you can set yourself up for success. If you want to learn more about how you can secure more listings, call or email me. I’d love to connect with you.
