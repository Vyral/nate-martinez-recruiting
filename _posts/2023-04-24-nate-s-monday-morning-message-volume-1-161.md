**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,161**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! Its another week filled with opportunities – are you ready? Today, I want to address those days when you just don’t feel your best – days when we are low and feeling like there is nothing good – days when we are stuck in what is called stinkin’-thinkin’. We’ve all been there. So what do you do to move through those low points and get back to feeling gratitude and joy? One proven way is to change your physiology. This could be a walk, taking a bath, watching a funny video on TikTok. Its impossible to feel blue if you are working out! And its scientifically proven that exercise and laughter increase the chemicals in the brain that activates the good feelings. Next time you are feeling a bit off, acknowledge why you might be feeling that way but don’t stay there too long – because you deserve to feel happy. Let’s make it a great week!&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

Secret Of Happiness

A wealthy man lived in a city. He was a very big businessman, and he was not short of anything but still he was always worried and restless. One day he went to his Hermitage to meet the sage in a village. The man told his problem to the sage that he has no shortage of anything but still he is always worried.

The sage heard his problem and said - come tomorrow, I will tell you how to stay happy and worry free.

The man reached the Hermitage of the sage at the same time the next day. He saw that the sage was looking for something outside his Hermitage.

The person said - Guruvar (sage) what are you looking for? May I help you! The sage said - I am looking for my ring, which is lost.

Hearing this, that person also started searching for his ring with the sage. Even after searching for a long time, the ring was not found, then the person asked the sage - where did your ring fall?

The sage said - My ring fell in the hut of the Hermitage, but it is very dark there, so I am looking for the ring outside the Hermitage.

The person asked with surprise - when your ring fell in the hut, why are you looking out here??&nbsp;

The sage said - this is the solution to your problem…

Moral: Happiness is inside you, but you are looking for it in money and foreign goods. The entire sea is inside you, but still, you are looking for water outside with a spoon. Money or property is important in life, but happiness cannot be bought only with money.
