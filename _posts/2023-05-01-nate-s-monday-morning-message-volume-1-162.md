**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,162**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope that each of you reading this had a wonderful weekend! Today I just want to do a little reminder as we rapidly approaching the mid-year point. &nbsp;If you desire to have better relationships, focus on being more present in the moment with those people. If you desire more confidence, focus on your self-image and the great things you have to share. If you desire more money, focus on continually doing the tasks you identified that will produce revenue and not the mundane nonsense of running your business. Focus is differentiators. Lots of people can come up with a plan. Lots of people have desires. The challenge for many is the focus needed to do what is needed day after day without getting thrown off track. Let’s make it a great week!&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

Successful Goal Setting Using S.M.A.R.T.E.R.S:

Specific – get clear about the goal<br>M: Measurable – what gets measured, gets done!<br>A: Achievable – be realistic about the goal<br>R: Relevant – does the goal line up with your core values?<br>T: Time-Bound – give it a deadline<br>E: Evaluate – inspect what you expect, every day<br>R: Readjust – change your approach if necessary&nbsp;

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Time can be an ally or an enemy. What it becomes depends entirely upon you, your goals, and your determination to use every available minute.” – Zig Ziglar

“If you want to accomplish the goals of your life, you have to begin with the spirit.” – Oprah Winfrey“

The new year stands before us, like a chapter in a book, waiting to be written. We can help write that story by setting goals.” – Melody Beattie
