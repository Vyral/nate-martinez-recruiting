As a real estate agent, you know the business is all about helping people buy and sell properties. However, you also know that some agents don't seem to be able to get the job done. So what's the deal? Why are some agents so successful while others struggle? There are quite a few ways to get yourself into hot water if you ignore what's happening around you and how it affects your business. Real estate can be a difficult industry to succeed in, but it doesn't have to be. To help you avoid the pitfalls, here are the three main reasons why many real estate agents fail:

**1\. Not managing time or expenses properly.** This is probably one of the biggest mistakes agents make when it comes to running their businesses. You need to properly budget both your money and your time to succeed in real estate. Make sure all your time is spent moving toward your goals. You will likely need at least six months of savings while starting out, but you always need to be careful with how much money you put into your various resources. Double down on the ones that work and ditch the ones that don’t give you a return.

**2\. Failing to market themselves and their properties properly.** Agents who don't market themselves effectively are missing out on potential clients. Make sure your marketing materials are up-to-date and enticing so that both sellers and buyers can find out about your business and listed properties right away. Your marketing should include social media posts, blog articles, YouTube videos, and email outreach. Level up the value that you provide to clients and make sure they find out about it somehow.&nbsp;

**3\. Not staying on top of lead generation.** Lead generation and prospecting are the most important skills a real estate agent can have. If you don't know how to generate leads, you will have a very difficult time growing your business. The key here is finding the right prospects who are interested in buying or selling their home at this moment in time. However, also make sure you follow up with potential clients who initially expressed interest but haven't committed yet. That could mean calling back once a week or maybe sending emails every few days—whatever works best for your style.&nbsp;

If you want to succeed as a real estate agent, it's important to remember that many factors can make or break your success. You need to find a balance between your money-making activities.
