**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,163**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I read this quote the other day by Vincent Van Gogh – “What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything?” That got me thinking and inspired me for today’s message. If early man had no courage, what would the world look like? Would we have ever discovered fire or electricity? Would we have the airplane or cars? Would we have put a man on the moon? The answer is no. Because all those amazing discoveries took courage – courage to ask what if, and courage to face the odds with unwavering faith. Where in your life could you have more courage? Dare to ask – why not you? Let’s make it a great week!&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

The Story of the Fig Tree (From “The Bell Jar”, by Sylvia Plath)

I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked.

One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out.

I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose.

I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.

**Moral of the story:**

Decide! Take action.
