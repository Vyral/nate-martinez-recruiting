**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,164**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well and ready to greet the new week with enthusiasm! Today I want to talk about peace…not peace like we said in the 60s but rather the feeling of a deep, loving gratitude for life. A pure energy that emanates from you with ease. A sense of balance and harmony in your life. We all need a moment of peace. Sometimes its not that easy with the chaos that can be reality. This week I’d like to challenge you to take a moment to consider the places in your life that you are not experiencing peace. What can you do today to make changes? What toxic relationships do you need to walk away from? What hard conversation do you need to have? We all deserve peace. Let’s make it a great week!&nbsp;

PS Sarah and I have decided to do a nationwide live stream on May 25th - we are going deep with the 8 concepts we wrote about in our bestselling book -&nbsp;[8 Ways to Dominate Any Real Estate Market](https://www.amazon.com/Ways-Dominate-Real-Estate-Market-ebook/dp/B09BJ7NY8K/ref=sr_1_1?crid=372JPJ02PQYV1&amp;keywords=8+ways+to+dominate+any+real+estate+market&amp;qid=1683836349&amp;sprefix=8+ways+to+%2Caps%2C162&amp;sr=8-1){: target="_blank"}.&nbsp;

We are going live at 9am PST/12noon EST - I'd love for you and your teams/brokerages to join us - we are super passionate about this and really want to help agents have a real estate business that dominates - no matter what is happening in the market!

I have attached the flyer with the QR code that you can scan to grab your virtual seat. We will see you there!
