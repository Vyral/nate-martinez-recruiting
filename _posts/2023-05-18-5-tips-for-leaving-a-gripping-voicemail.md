Leaving a voicemail can be awkward at the best of times. However, as agents, voicemails can still be powerful, persuasive tools that draw in new clients. There is an art to leaving a gripping voicemail, though.&nbsp;

The key is immediately grabbing the person’s attention with specific, relevant information spoken in a confident but not salesy tone. If you overwhelm them with information, sound too much like a salesperson, or don’t hook them within the first few seconds, your efforts may backfire. Today I’ll share a few key tips that will help you leave a sales voicemail that will get your prospects to call you back:

**1\. Use first names only.** Using titles like Miss, Mrs., and Mr. sounds far too formal; instead, start your message with a quick greeting followed by their first name only. Don’t use your full name, as that will make you sound like a cold caller. Use only your first name and immediately follow it with your company name \[e.g., “Hi, (insert prospect’s name)! This is John at XYZ Real Estate Company…”\].

**2\. Make sure your call is relevant to the recipient.** Calling someone just to check in is a transparent ploy to get someone on the phone, and it can be off-putting. Your message needs a context that entices the prospect to keep listening. For example, if you track them using a feature on your site to look for homes, use that to establish common ground with them.

**3\. Lead with the benefits.** People are much more likely to respond if you share how they’ll benefit by doing so. In your voicemail, quickly get to the point about how your product or service will help improve their lives.

**4\. Be cognizant of your tone and speed.** Do your best to drop your salesy voice. If you sound too much like you’re trying to sell something, they probably won’t even finish the message. Instead, adopt a friendly, confident, and casual tone to avoid sounding desperate. If you smile while you speak, your energy will be reflected in your tone. Similarly, don’t speak too quickly. As Charlene DeCesare, the founder of Firewalk Sales School, says, “Say less and slow down. You want them to feel that talking to you will make their lives less stressful. If you're frantic and mumbling on the phone, it gives them a foreshadowing of what it will be like to work with you."

**5\. Give prospects alternative means to contact you.** Some clients may not like communicating on the phone. Be sure to clearly provide an email address so they can respond to you at their convenience.

Leaving a well-crafted voicemail message can mean the difference between gaining a client and scaring them away. Use these tips to help you hit your monthly goals, and feel free to experiment with different scripts to optimize your approach.&nbsp;
