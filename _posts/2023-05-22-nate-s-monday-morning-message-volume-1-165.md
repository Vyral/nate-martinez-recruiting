**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,165**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope you had a wonderful weekend and found some quiet time to relax and recoup. I read this quote the other day, which is my inspiration for today’s message: “We are all gifted. That is our inheritance.” – Ethel Waters. We are all gifted – and what better inheritance is there than discovering and developing your natural gifts and abilities. We are here for a purpose and the day we find that out, is the day we begin to truly live. Have you discovered your gifts? Let’s make it a great week!&nbsp;

PS Sarah and I have decided to do a nationwide live stream on May 25th - we are going deep with the 8 concepts we wrote about in our bestselling book -&nbsp;[8 Ways to Dominate Any Real Estate Market](https://www.amazon.com/Ways-Dominate-Real-Estate-Market-ebook/dp/B09BJ7NY8K/ref=sr_1_1?crid=372JPJ02PQYV1&amp;keywords=8+ways+to+dominate+any+real+estate+market&amp;qid=1683836349&amp;sprefix=8+ways+to+%2Caps%2C162&amp;sr=8-1){: target="_blank"}.&nbsp;

We are going live at 9am PST/12noon EST - I'd love for you and your teams/brokerages to join us - we are super passionate about this and really want to help agents have a real estate business that dominates - no matter what is happening in the market!

I have attached the flyer with the QR code that you can scan to grab your virtual seat. We will see you there!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

The Dragon and the Treasure

In many ancient myths and stories the hero has to go on a long and perilous journey to complete their mission. A classic example?

The sleepless dragon that guards its treasure, breathing fire on anyone who so dares to steal it.

To get the gold, the knight in shining armour must, through guile or force, first defeat this beast.

**Moral of the story:**

Success lies on the other side of effort, which makes suffering part of the process.

Rather than avoid discomfort then, the ambitious must pursue it at all costs. Only by butting heads and pushing through such suffering will they ever attain the proverbial gold.
