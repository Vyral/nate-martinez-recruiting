**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,167**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! Today I want to talk about the power of a friendly smile. You can literally change someone’s entire day including your own just by smiling. Smiling is also an effective means of communication – no words required. Smiling is free therapy. This week I’d like to challenge you to pass out as many free smiles as you can – and start by looking in the mirror. Let’s make it a great week!&nbsp;



**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

Jim and the Job

My neighbor Jim had trouble deciding if he wanted to retire from the construction field until he ran into a younger man he’d worked with previously. The man had a wife and three children, and was finding it difficult to make ends meet, as he hadn’t worked in some time. The next morning Jim went to the union office and submitted his retirement paperwork. As for his replacement, he gave them the name of struggling young man. That was six years ago, and that young husband and father has been employed ever since. —*Miranda MacLean, Brutus, Michigan.*
