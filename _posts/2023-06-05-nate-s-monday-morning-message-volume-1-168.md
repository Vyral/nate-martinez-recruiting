**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,168**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well and ready to bring on a new week – its hard to believe the mild summer we’ve experienced so far in the Valley of the Sun! I wanted to use this email today to give a shout out to all the hard-working dads who show up every day to do the work for their family. Dads don’t get much attention – and usually end up behind the grill on Father’s Day! I know how difficult it can be to be a dad; I know I have made plenty of mistakes. To all the dads reading this, have a great week and know that you are loved and appreciated – every day not just Father’s Day. Let’s make it a great week!&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

“Talking is like ketchup”

I sat in my dad’s living room reading one night while he watched television. An hour passed before I realized it, and I felt bad for not speaking during that time. I asked if he was OK, and he said yes. Then I apologized for not talking more. “Carmen,” Dad replied. “Talking is like ketchup. If you like the meat enough, you don’t need the ketchup—and if you like the company enough, you don’t need the conversation.” My dad never earned a college degree, but he was the smartest person I ever knew. —*Carmen Mariano, Braintree, Massachusetts*



**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“My father used to say that it's never too late to do anything you wanted to do. And he said, 'You never know what you can accomplish until you try.'” - Michael Jordan

“I decided in my life that I would do nothing that did not reflect positively on my father's life.” - Sidney Poitier

“My Dad is my hero.” - Harry Connick, Jr.
