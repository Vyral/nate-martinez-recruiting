**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,169**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! Today we are looking at the history of this important day…as we all know, the Emancipation Proclamation was made effective in 1863, however not every black person was free. The Confederate state of Texas enslaved people and it wasn’t until 2,000 Union Troops arrived in Galveston Bay on June 19, 1865. The army declared more than 250,000 enslaved black people were free by executive decree. This day became known as “Juneteenth” – and it marks our country’s second Independence Day. Today, I would like to ask that you take a moment to reflect on what it means to be free; and pay respect to why it’s our human right. Let’s make it a great week!&nbsp;

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“You must never, ever give out. We must keep the faith because we are one people. We are brothers and sisters. We all live in the same house: The American house.” — John Lewis

“We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” - Thomas Jefferson

“Even though the story has never been tidy, and Black folks have had to march and fight for every inch of our freedom, our story is nonetheless one of progress.” —Michelle Obama
