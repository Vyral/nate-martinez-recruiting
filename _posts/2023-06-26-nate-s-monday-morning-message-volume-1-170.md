**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,170**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I read this quote the other day, which has inspired my topic for today: “Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them humanity cannot survive.” - Dalai Lama. Compassion is a big, beautiful word but not always an easy word to live by. When anger, frustration, resentment exist, its hard to have compassion. However, compassion can lead us through dark times and into the light of love. This week I’d like to challenge you to have a little extra compassion – for yourself, your family, your annoying next-door neighbor – without love and compassion, humanity cannot survive. Let’s make it a great week!&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

Sympathy looks in and says, “I’m**&nbsp;**sorry.” Compassion goes in and says, “I’m**&nbsp;**with you.”

Sympathy looks in and says, “I would like to help.”Compassion goes in and says, “I am here to help.”

Sympathy says, “I wish I could carry your burden.”Compassion says, “Cast your burden on me.”

Sympathy often irritates many words. Compassion helps and hears in quietness and understanding.
