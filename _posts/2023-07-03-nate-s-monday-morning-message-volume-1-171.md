**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,171**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! Last week I got to spend two days with a group of elite coaches from around the U.S. It is important to spend time with like-minded people who help you grow and develop as a human being. They shared something new to me, called Socratic questions. Which basically are a series of questions that probe, clarify and provide evidence of reality. Communication can be a challenge, especially if it’s a sensitive subject.

What else could we assume? What would happen if…? What exactly does this mean? How does it relate to what we have been talking about? Can you give me an example? Why is this happening? What evidence is there to support what you are saying?

I shared these questions with you, in hopes that you might use them in your life the next time you need to have a deeper conversation. Let’s make it a great week!&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

THE THIRSTY CROW STORY

A long time ago, during a devastating spell of dry weather, there was a thirsty crow who was desperate for a drink of water.

The poor crow flew and flew in search of a means to quench his thirst.

From one place to another he went, until, at long last, when he could fly no further, he came upon a large pitcher of water at the base of a tree.

Overjoyed, the thirsty crow thrust its jet-black beak inside to drink his fill.

But, alas, the pitcher had a narrow neck!

Try as he might, the despairing crow couldn’t get his head far enough inside. To his dismay, he realized the water was out of reach.

The thirsty crow cried out and flapped his wings in anguish.

He attempted to knock the pitcher over. But to no avail. It was too heavy for his weary, dehydrated body to budge.

The crow was on the verge of exhaustion and ready to fly elsewhere.

But then an idea came to him.

Around the base of the pitcher sat some small round pebbles.

Picking them up, one by one, the thirsty crow dropped them into the pitcher. Again and again he placed these stones inside.

And with every extra pebble, the water level began to rise…

His idea worked.

Eventually, after much toil, the water rose so high inside the pitcher that the clever crow was able to drink his fill and sate his thirst for good.

MORAL OF THIRSTY CROW STORY \#1:

First, that “*necessity’s the mother of invention.*”

In moments of difficulty, you have to rise to the challenge!

Where there’s a will, there’s a way.
