**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,173**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! The summer heat is a real scorcher this week in the Valley of the Sun! I hope you stayed hydrated and found some time to relax and recoup. Today, I am sharing this touching story that came across my email below in the encouragement corner. It’s a great reminder of how important it is to honor a commitment, whether that is to yourself or your business. As the owner of RE/MAX Professionals, I am committed to providing world-class service, to my clients and the agents I am proud to have in our brokerage. What are you committed to? Let’s make it a great week!&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

Big corporate hotel chains have never lacked criticism and customer complaints, but in downtown Kansas City, one Marriot is honoring a promise that its representatives made almost 40 years ago.

Tim and Melinda O’Brien got married in 1983 and wanted to go “where nobody would think to look for us” for a fast honeymoon getaway.

They selected the Radisson Muehlebach hotel, but due to unforeseen circumstances, they didn’t stay there long enough for the important part.

Fast forward to 2023, and the couple is preparing to celebrate 40 years of partnership, and that’s when combing through their wedding album they came across a gift certificate certifying that “anytime you stay at the Radisson Muehlebach during your anniversary month, your room rate will be the same as your original honeymoon rate.”

Back then, that was just 38 bucks. How times change.

“I wonder if they’ll still honor this,” Tim O’Brien thought to himself.

To the credit of the hotel—now a Marriot instead of a Radisson—they did, and while the room they stayed in no longer exists, they had some very comparable ones.

“I can’t take credit for that marketing initiative,” Dustin Holcumbrink, the hotel manager&nbsp;[told KMBC 9 news](https://www.kmbc.com/article/gift-certificate-helps-kansas-city-couple-celebrate-special-night/44214367){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;with a smile on his face.

“This is what marriage is all about, memories, special things that you experience together,” said Melinda.

The couple plans to use the certificate to stay at the hotel over the weekend of their anniversary on June 25th to attend a few jazz nights, and take care of some unfinished business after that.
