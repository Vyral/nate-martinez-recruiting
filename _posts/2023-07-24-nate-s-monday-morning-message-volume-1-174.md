**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,174**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I trust that you are well and ready for the final week of July 2023! Some of you already have kiddos back in school, but in our house, we are preparing for the big day. I love the first day of school – a day full of anticipation, excitement, and opportunity. It’s a reminder that we should always be learning, growing and striving to be the best we can be. Take a moment this week to enjoy the innocents of children who leave the house on the first day of school, wide-eyed and ready to take on the world. Let’s make it a great week!&nbsp;
