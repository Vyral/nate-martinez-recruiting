**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,175**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! Tomorrow is the beginning of our favorite month – the month of August is the Month of Miracles! Since 1992, RE/MAX has been a proud partner of CMN Hospitals, with the RE/MAX network supporting and donating to the 170 CMN affiliate hospitals across the U.S. and Canada. All year round – and especially during the Month of Miracles every August – we fundraise to benefit our local Phoenix Children’s Hospital. This year is no exception. You can stop by any of our offices to make a donation if you feel inspired to help us reach our goal this year. Let’s make it a great week!&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

Meet Anderson

[**El Paso Children's Hospital Foundation**](https://elpasochildrensfoundation.childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/)

For the first three years of Anderson's life, he received evaluations and tests to monitor developmental milestones for his age. Everything always came back normal, though his mom always felt there was something wrong. When Anderson was three, he was diagnosed with Arnold Chiari malformation. Within five days, he was taken into surgery. Within two weeks of recovering from his surgery, Anderson rode a scooter for the first time. He crossed a balance beam at the park. He gave the tightest hugs. He ate his food without regurgitating and asked for seconds at mealtime. He started putting on weight and growing, meeting the typical milestones for children his age. The experts at El Paso Children's Hospital were able to use neurology-specific equipment funded by donations. These pediatric-specific tools allow for endoscopic procedures to be less invasive, have better outcomes and shorten the length of a hospital stay.



**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“There are only two lasting bequests we can hope to give our children. One of these is roots, the other, wings.” - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

“Where we love is home - home that our feet may leave, but not our hearts.” - Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.

“Don't worry that children never listen to you; worry that they are always watching you.” - Robert Fulghum
