**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,176**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well and ready to usher in a new week! I was speaking to someone the other day and the poem below came up in our conversation; I thought I would share it with you today (again). It is a powerful reminder that we are capable of so much – and if we live up to our potential, we can change the world one day at a time. Let’s make it a great week!&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

Our Greatest Fear —Marianne Williamson

It is our light not our darkness that most frightens us.

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.

Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.

It is our light not our darkness that most frightens us.

We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous?Actually, who are you not to be?

You are a child of God.

Your playing small does not serve the world.

There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you.We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone.

And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.As we are liberated from our own fear, Our presence automatically liberates others.&nbsp; —Marianne Williamson

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“The foundation stones for a balanced success are honesty, character, integrity, faith, love and loyalty.” - Zig Ziglar

“There is no limit to the power of loving.” - John Morton

“Don't aim for success if you want it; just do what you love and believe in, and it will come naturally.” - David Frost
