Today, I’m here to talk about consistency. With all of my experience as a Realtor, I know the importance of this concept. What is your routine? What do you do every day when you get up? The truth is that having a routine is crucial and all of the top-producing Realtors stick to one.&nbsp;

**One of the most important things you need to put into your routine is prospecting.** Whether it be cold calling, hosting open houses, or many other avenues, you need to be consistent with your prospecting. To help with this, I recommend a follow-up strategy that goes with the ABCs.

**{% include pullquote.html %}**

The A stands for someone who is your client and who you are constantly in contact with. The B stands for someone who might not buy a home for another 30 to 90 days, and you need to contact them twice a month. Then, the C stands for the clients who will take longer than 90 days to take action in real estate, and if you stay consistent with them, there’s a good chance they’ll come to you when they’re ready to act.&nbsp;

Overall, know that prospecting and consistency need to be top priorities for you. If you’d like a few details on how I lay out my routine, I’d be happy to help you. Just call or email me anytime and I can share some of the many tools I’ve gained during my 36 years in this industry.
