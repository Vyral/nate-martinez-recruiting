**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,177**

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message…I hope this email finds you well! I just got back from a golf trip in Colorado where not only did I get to play on one of the best courses in the US, but I also got to spend quality time with a group of men who I admire and respect. They say you are the average of the five people closest to you, which I think is true. When I think back on my life, every milestone was an opportunity to level up my game, and I have been blessed to have people in my life who push me to the next level. I think that is important to have at least one person in your life who pushes you outside of your comfort zone, someone who sees your potential and helps you find it. Do you have that person in your life? If not, call me – I will be there for you. Let’s make it a great week!&nbsp;

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

If It Doesn’t Challenge You, It Doesn’t Change You!

A long time ago a King was gifted two eaglets (baby eagles). The king was very pleased with the gift & decided to hire an experienced caretaker for them.

One day, after the eaglets grew up, the King said to the man taking care of the eagles, “I want to see their flight.”

The man signaled both eagles to fly. Both started fluttering as soon as they saw the signal. But when one eagle was touching the heights of the sky, the other flew for some seconds and returned to the branch where it was earlier sitting.

Seeing this, the King asked the caretaker, “What’s the matter with the second eagle?” The caretaker replied, “It had this problem from the beginning, he does not leave that branch.”

The King loved both eagles fondly and desperately wanted to see the second one also fly. So, the next day he announced in the whole state that the person who manages to make the second eagle fly will be rewarded with heavy prices.

After the announcement, many trained professionals came forward to try, but in vain. The king too lost hope and almost gave up.

Then one day, a man turned up. He managed to make the second eagle fly to everyone’s surprise. The King, while interacting with the man, came to know that he was a simple farmer.

When the King asked how he managed to do it, the man said, “I simply cut the branch. The branch on which he had a habit of sitting. As there was no branch, he had no option but to fly which he did very well.”

Like the eagle in this story, we also sometimes underestimate ourselves and don’t realize our true potential. A comfort zone is a beautiful place to be, but nothing ever grows there.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Try new things, step out of your comfort zone, take risks, do things in ways you've never done them before, ask for help, surround yourself with self-actualized people, become obsessed with the fact that you have one go-round on this planet as the you that is you, and realize how precious and important it is not to squander that.” - Jen Sincero

“The best things in life are often waiting for you at the exit ramp of your comfort zone.” - Karen Salmansohn

“Ability is what you're capable of doing. Motivation determines what you do. Attitude determines how well you do it.” - Lou Holtz
