**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,178**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…this week I wanted to talk about happiness. Many of us do not spend that much time thinking about our own happiness. We go about our day just doing whatever we can to get to the next day. When we do think about happiness it is mostly about how we can make the people around us happier. I would suggest to you that true happiness is contagious. If you are happy with who you are, the things you are doing, and the way you are doing them, you will certainly be in a better place to make others happy.

This week let’s take some time to focus on happiness and how to create more of it in your life. When you are happier, the people around you will be too. When you are happier, your situation looks better. When you are happier, great things happen. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&nbsp;**

A couple of years ago, I stumbled off the subway in Upper Manhattan, exhausted after a long and stressful day at work, dreaming about the warmth of my bed. I stopped in a 7/11 on the way to my apartment to buy a bag of popcorn (treat yourself!). A man about three times my size stood in front of me at the register buying a pack of cigarettes and turned toward me, telling me I looked tired. I smiled uncomfortably and became noticeably more alert, as a young woman does when a strange man starts talking to her at night. He turned toward the cashier and said that he was going to get my snack too. I politely declined and was already pulling out my wallet, but this man wouldn’t allow me to say no. He handed the cashier a couple of extra dollars to cover my popcorn and told me that he hoped my night got better. He walked out of the store and I never saw him again.
