**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,179**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope this email finds you recharged from the weekend and ready to dive into a new week. I was hoping that we might start to see a break in the heat, but it looks like we are in for another hot one in the Valley of the Sun – but this is why we love the winters, right? Today let’s talk about fitness. I will admit I have a love-hate with working out but when I do it consistently, I notice a difference not only in my waistline but also in my attitude. We only get one body and taking care of it should be a priority. This week I’d like to challenge you to find some time for a little fitness, even if its as simple as a short walk around the block or an extra sit-up while you are watching Netflix. Take care of your body and it will take care of you. Let’s make it a great week!

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Time and health are two precious assets that we don't recognize and appreciate until they have been depleted.” - Denis Waitley

“Exercise to stimulate, not to annihilate. The world wasn't formed in a day, and neither were we. Set small goals and build upon them.” - Lee Haney

“Take care of your body. It's the only place you have to live.” - Jim Rohn
