**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,180**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well and enjoying an extra day off. For the last 141 years American’s have celebrated Labor Day to honor and recognize the labor movement and the contributions of laborers who shaped the achievements of the U.S. As you fire up the BBQs this afternoon, I hope you’ll take a moment to remember those before us who paved the way. Happy Labor Day! Let’s make it a great week!

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Each year, Labor Day gives us an opportunity to recognize the invaluable contributions that working men and women make to our nation, our economy and our collective prosperity. It gives us a chance to show gratitude for workers' grit, dedication, ingenuity and strength, which define our nation's character.” - Tom Perez

“Rules like 'don't wear white after Labor Day' or 'shoes matching the handbag' are antiquated. Modern women should feel free to experiment.” - Stacy London

“Labor Day is seen as a day of rest for many hardworking Americans.” - James P. Hoffa
