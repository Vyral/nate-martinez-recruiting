How can you get more leads in today’s competitive environment? You may think you’re trying every method to find good leads, but there is probably one method you’re underutilizing: open houses. Many agents don’t bother with open houses, but a packed house will help you make tons of contacts with people who are looking to move soon. If you master the art of the open house, you can turn one home sale into tons of high-quality leads. Here are three tips to help you pack your open houses and take your business to the next level:&nbsp;

**1\. Pick the right time.** When picking the right time to host your client’s open house, there are a few rules you should follow. First, make sure you host your open house on a weekend so that people have time to attend. If it works for your seller, Sunday is the best day of the week. Next, pick the right time of day. If your client is in an urban area, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. is the best time, while those living in the suburbs should open between 12 p.m. and 4 p.m.

**2\. Market like a pro.** Once you’ve picked the ideal time, you need to let people know that the open house is happening. Dedicate yourself to marketing the event everywhere you can, like the MLS, Facebook, your blog, your database, etc. When you create a Facebook page for the event and/or send out emails, make sure you’re including professional photos of the house. Finally, physical signs in your client’s neighborhood will make it easy for people to find the property even if they’re just passing through on a whim.

**3\. Network, network, network.** The primary goal of your open house should be to provide value to your client, but that doesn’t have to be your only objective. Most people who are looking to buy a home also have a property to sell, so talk to attendees and let them know that you work with both buyers and sellers. Even adding people to your database can pay off in the long run when they eventually need to buy or sell.&nbsp;

Mastering the art of the open house takes time, so if you have any questions about these tips or something else, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I hope to hear from you soon!
