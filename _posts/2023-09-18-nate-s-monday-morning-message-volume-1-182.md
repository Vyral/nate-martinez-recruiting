**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,182**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! How did your team do this week in football? This is a great time of year when the summer temps are waning and the excitement as we welcome fall. Its also a great time to reflect on your goals, your achievements and course correct for Q4 if necessary. In my business, and I would guess for most businesses, what we do today impacts our life/business 30 to 45 days from now. So, if you want to finish the year strong you have to focus on the right activities, consistently. You can do it! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

The Queen’s Boulder

In ancient times there was a queen who ordered her soldiers to manoeuvre a boulder into the middle of the main road to and from town.

The queen then hid, watching to see who would stop to do the right thing and move it out of the way again.

Wealthy merchants and courtiers passed the boulder, barely giving it a second thought. A few of them blamed their queen for not keeping the roads clear. Yet none stopped to do anything.

One day, a peasant walked along with a sack of vegetables to sell at market.

He stopped, laid these down, and then pushed, tugged, huffed, and heaved the stone away.

Upon picking up his vegetables, the peasant saw a large purse full of gold and a handwritten note from the queen herself where the boulder had been.

The gold was a reward for whoever removed it from the road.

Moral of the story: Laziness will never get you anywhere in life. Success almost always takes humility and hard work.
