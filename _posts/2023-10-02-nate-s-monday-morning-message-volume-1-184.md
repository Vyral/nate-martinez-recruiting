**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,184**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Welcome October! Don’t you love the cooler mornings? This is the best time of year for the Valley of the Sun – and it’s the best time of year to dive into your goals and plans for the future. Take time to reflect on how the year has been so far, what you’d like to do before you ring in the New Year and make plans for 2024. Every day is full of opportunities – October is a magical month – make every day count. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

October written by Robert Frost

O hushed October morning mild,

Thy leaves have ripened to the fall;

Tomorrow’s wind, if it be wild,

Should waste them all.

The crows above the forest call;

Tomorrow they may form and go.

O hushed October morning mild,

Begin the hours of this day slow.

Make the day seem to us less brief.

Hearts not averse to being beguiled,

Beguile us in the way you know.

Release one leaf at break of day;

At noon release another leaf;

One from our trees, one far away.

Retard the sun with gentle mist;

Enchant the land with amethyst.

Slow, slow!

For the grapes’ sake, if they were all,

Whose leaves already are burnt with frost,

Whose clustered fruit must else be lost—

For the grapes’ sake along the wall.
