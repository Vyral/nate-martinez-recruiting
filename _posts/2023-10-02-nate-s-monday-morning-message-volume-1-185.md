**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,185**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Welcome to a new week; I hope you are rested and ready to crush it. Today is Indigenous People’s Day, which is a day to celebrate and honor the indigenous Americans who came before us – it’s a day to commemorate their rich history and cultures. Whether you are working or have an extra day to your weekend, I hope you’ll take a moment to remember and recognize the indigenous people. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Nunaqtigiit (people related through common possession of territory)

Joan Naviyuk Kane

The enemy misled that missed the island in the fog,I believe in one or the other, but both exist now to confuse me. Dark from dark.

Snow from snow. I believe in one—

Craggy boundary, knife blade at the throat’s slight swell.

From time to time the sound of voices as through sun-singed grass,

or grasses that we used to insulate the walls of our winter houses—walrus hides lashed together with rawhide cords.

So warm within the willows ingathered forced into leaf.

I am named for your sister Naviyuk: call me&nbsp;*apoŋ*.

Surely there are ghosts here, my children sprung from these deeper furrows.

The sky of my mind against which self-betrayal in its sudden burn fails to describe the world.

We, who denied the landscape and saw the light of it.

Leaning against the stone wall raggedI began to accept my past and, as I accepted it,

I felt, and I didn’t understand: I am bound to everyone.
