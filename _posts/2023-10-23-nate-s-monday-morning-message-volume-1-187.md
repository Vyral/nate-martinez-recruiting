**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,187**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! The fall weather has finally arrived! Are you looking forward to sweaters and firepits? I know I am! And before we know it, the holidays are going to be here. I’d like to challenge you this week to take a moment to identify what you need to do to end the month strong with your goals. We are on the final stretch – are you on track? Do you need to course correct? Double down let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

The Weight of the Glass

Once upon a time a psychology professor walked around on a stage while teaching stress management principles to an auditorium filled with students.&nbsp; As she raised a glass of water, everyone expected they’d be asked the typical “glass half empty or glass half full” question.&nbsp; Instead, with a smile on her face, the professor asked, “How heavy is this glass of water I’m holding?

Students shouted out answers ranging from eight ounces to a couple pounds.

She replied, “From my perspective, the absolute weight of this glass doesn’t matter.&nbsp; It all depends on how long I hold it.&nbsp; If I hold it for a minute or two, it’s fairly light.&nbsp; If I hold it for an hour straight, its weight might make my arm ache a little.&nbsp; If I hold it for a day straight, my arm will likely cramp up and feel completely numb and paralyzed, forcing me to drop the glass to the floor.&nbsp; In each case, the weight of the glass doesn’t change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it feels to me.”

As the class shook their heads in agreement, she continued, “Your stresses and worries in life are very much like this glass of water.&nbsp; Think about them for a while and nothing happens.&nbsp; Think about them a bit longer and you begin to ache a little.&nbsp; Think about them all day long, and you will feel completely numb and paralyzed – incapable of doing anything else until you drop them.”

**The moral:**&nbsp; It’s important to remember to let go of your stresses and worries.&nbsp; No matter what happens during the day, as early in the evening as you can, put all your burdens down.&nbsp; Don’t carry them through the night and into the next day with you.&nbsp; If you still feel the weight of yesterday’s stress, it’s a strong sign that it’s time to put the glass down. &nbsp;*(Angel and I discuss this process of letting go in the Adversity and Self-Love chapters of&nbsp;[1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently](https://www.marcandangel.com/book/).)*

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Once you replace negative thoughts with positive ones, you'll start having positive results.” - Willie Nelson

“Did I offer peace today? Did I bring a smile to someone's face? Did I say words of healing? Did I let go of my anger and resentment? Did I forgive? Did I love? These are the real questions. I must trust that the little bit of love that I sow now will bear many fruits, here in this world and the life to come.” - Henri Nouwen

“You cannot have a positive life and a negative mind.” - Joyce Meyer
