**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,189**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! This week we will be paying tribute to Veterans, to acknowledge their service and contribution to our nation’s security. If you are reading this and you are a Veteran, please let me be the first to thank you for your sacrifice and dedication to our great country. I hope you’ll take a moment this week to thank a Veteran and let them know how much we appreciate their selfless commitment – happy Veterans Day! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

A Veteran by Reginald Gibbons

My father came down not killed

from among others, killers or killed,

for whom he'd worn a uniform,

and he lived a long afterward,

a steady man on the flattest of plains.

I called after him many times, surprised

when I heard the catch in my own voice.

He didn't know how to find the solace

of listening to someone else speak of

what he'd seen and survived.

He himself closed his own

mouth against his own words.

In the wrong sequence, his spirit,

then his mind, and last his body

crossed over that infamous, peat-inky,

metaphorical water that has no far shore.

I think he was carried like a leaf

in currents so gentle that a duckling,

had it been alive, could have braved them,

but too strong for a leaf. And saturated

with minerals that steadily replaced

organic cells, the water turned my father,

an ex-soldier, to leaf-delicate stone inscribed

with the axioms of countless veins.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“On this Veterans Day, let us remember the service of our veterans, and let us renew our national promise to fulfill our sacred obligations to our veterans and their families who have sacrificed so much so that we can live free.” - Dan Lipinski“Live as brave men; and if fortune is adverse, front its blows with brave hearts.” - Marcus Tullius Cicero

“True heroism is remarkably sober, very undramatic. It is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at whatever cost.” - Arthur Ashe
