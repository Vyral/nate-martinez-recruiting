If you’ve been in the real estate industry for a while, you are probably all too familiar with burnout. Helping people buy and sell homes is no easy task, especially when you have to constantly be thinking about where your next paycheck is coming from. When business is flowing, it’s easy to get up early and find more leads, but business doesn’t come easy in some markets. Don’t let a down period spiral into burnout; here are three simple tips to help you stay motivated:

**1\. Find your big “why.”**&nbsp;When you ask most agents why they went into the business, they have a simple answer, like money, freedom, or excitement. However, this isn’t usually the full story. Behind every reason for getting into real estate is a deeper, more meaningful motivation. For example, you might have gotten into the industry to make more money, but maybe that desire comes from wanting to protect your family from financial insecurity. Whatever your “why” is, having a strong reason to get up every morning can keep you going through the hard times.

**2\. Set SMART goals.** In case you don’t know, SMART goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound. Large, vague goals don’t work because it’s hard to tell if you’re making any progress toward them. This leads to a feeling of futility and can even lead to the burnout you’re trying to avoid. On the other hand, SMART goals provide you with a sense of accomplishment every day as you get closer to each finish line.&nbsp;

**3\. Have a strong support system.** No matter how strong and motivated you are, eventually, you’re going to need a little help. Your family can provide a strong support structure as well as an escape from the real estate world. Real estate teams are also a great source of support, and many also provide systems to help you avoid burnout. Finally, a personal mentor or coach has probably been through plenty of burnout in their career, and they can be a shoulder to lean on and a source of advice.&nbsp;

No matter what your experience level in the industry is, real estate can be a tough business, but you don’t have to do it alone. If you have questions about this topic or anything else, I’m just a call or email away. I look forward to hearing from you.
