**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,191**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well and that all your preparation and planning for the holiday are underway. It will be a busy week filled with experiences that shape our memories. While it is easy to get caught up in the cooking and decorating, its important to take a few minutes this week to express your gratitude – in a world where you can be anything, having a grateful heart is a gift, not only to yourself but those around you – and I am grateful for each of you who start your day with this email. I am grateful for every client we’ve had the pleasure of serving, every agent, and my leadership team who are a part of RE/MAX Professionals. Lastly, I am grateful for my family – for without them, I would not be the man I am today. From our home to yours, we wish you a very happy, healthy and grateful Thanksgiving. Let’s make it a great week!

Turning Heartache Into Hope

Nolan was diagnosed with kidney cancer just before his first birthday. Within a week, surgeons at Phoenix Children’s removed the tumor. It was a mass that engulfed his entire abdomen—a weight of 2.5 pounds in his 19-pound body. Click on the image to watch his story on YouTube.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Gratitude is the inward feeling of kindness received. Thankfulness is the natural impulse to express that feeling. Thanksgiving is the following of that impulse.” - Henry Van Dyke

“Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow.” - Melody Beattie

“An optimist is a person who starts a new diet on Thanksgiving Day.” - Irv Kupcinet
