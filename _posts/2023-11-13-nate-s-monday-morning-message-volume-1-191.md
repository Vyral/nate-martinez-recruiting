**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,191**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well and ready for the blessings that lie ahead in this new week. Today, I’d like to talk about adversity – specifically asking how do you overcome it? I have been selling real estate for 36 years and I have seen every type of market – from the dot.com burst, the bubble and bust, the short sale market – and at the time, those adversities felt like they were a disaster; they felt impossible to navigate. However, looking back we always found a way to overcome it and dare I say, we came out the other side better for having experienced the challenges. What adversities do you face in your life right now? Can you see the opportunities? I’d love to hear from you. Let’s support each other, and let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Imagine that you are juggling five balls.

Each of them represents important parts of our life – family, health, spirit, friends and job.

Four balls are made of glass and only one is made of rubber.

We need to recognize that job is a rubber ball. While family, friends, health and spirit are very fragile, as if you drop one of them, they will be irreversibly damaged or even shattered.

This understanding will help to keep the balance in your life.
