**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,192**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! How was your holiday weekend? I hope you were surrounded by love, laughter and all your favorite holiday foods! We spent the weekend in Flagstaff, where it was chilly but a great change of pace to start the hustle and bustle this time of year brings to our days. There are only five weeks left in 2023 – are you happy with how this year has gone for you? Is there anything you still want to accomplish? Its easy this time of year to take your foot off the gas especially when we are distracted by the tinsel and merriment. But you owe it to yourself, your family and your life to show up and do the work. You got this; I believe in you! &nbsp;Let’s make it a great week!
