**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,193**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope this message finds you well, rested, and ready for the first week of December 2023. We have some exciting news at RE/MAX Professionals – we have expanded our location to Tucson with the merger of RE/MAX Select. I want to welcome the 19 agents to our family – and for those of you who need real estate services in southern AZ, we now have you covered. I will close this message with a thought about growth and opportunity – we should always be looking for opportunities to grow and expand whether that is as big as a new business venture or the simplicity of reading a new book. Life is about growth and finding your potential. There are less than 30 days left in 2023 – what growth do you still need to do this year? I’d love to hear it - let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Once a young man asked the wise man, Socrates, the secret to success. Socrates patiently listened to the man’s question and told him to meet him near the river the following day for the answer. So the next day, Socrates asked the young man to walk with him towards the river. As they went in the river, the water got up to their neck. But to the young man’s surprise, Socrates ducked him into the water.

The young man struggled to get out of the water, but Socrates was strong and kept him there until the boy started turning blue. Finally, Socrates pulled the man’s head out of the water. The young man gasped and took a deep breath of air. Socrates asked, ‘What did you want the most when your head was in the water?” The young man replied, “Air.” Socrates said, “That is the secret to success. When you want success as badly as you wanted the air while you were in the water, then you will get it. There is no other secret.”

Moral of the short story: ** ** A burning desire is the starting point of all accomplishment. Just like a small fire cannot give much heat, a weak desire cannot produce great results.
