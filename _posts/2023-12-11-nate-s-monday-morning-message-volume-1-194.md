**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,194**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope you had a wonderful weekend filled with joy and laughter; that you started your holiday season creating memories you will cherish for years to come. For me, one of the best parts of this time of year is the traditions that we celebrate, which have been passed down from our grandparents, parents, etc. There is something so nostalgic about an old family recipe, or a special ornament for the tree or cultural traditions that we only do or have during this time of year. Traditions are the bond that keep families united and carry on the legacy of those who came before us. I am blessed to have my own family traditions, but also celebrate the traditions that Tonya brings to my life. I’d love to hear some of your – shoot me back an email and let me know what your traditions are. Let’s make it a great week!

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“I like to compare the holiday season with the way a child listens to a favorite story. The pleasure is in the familiar way the story begins, the anticipation of familiar turns it takes, the familiar moments of suspense, and the familiar climax and ending.” - Fred Rogers

“Maybe Christmas, the Grinch thought, doesn't come from a store.” - Dr. Seuss

“A man who is a master of patience is master of everything else.” - George Savile
