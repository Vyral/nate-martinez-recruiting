**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,195**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Are you ready for the big day? I don’t know about you but this month seemed to have flown by in the blink of an eye! We were blessed to host a wonderful holiday celebration for our company on Friday evening. Thank you to everyone who turned out for a bit of merriment; it was a great time and I continue to be amazed by those who surround me. As you make your final preparations for the holiday weekend, I hope you will find a moment to express your gratitude to those who are in your life. It our fast-paced world, especially the hustle and bustle of the holiday season, it can be easy to overlook gratitude and take things for granted. On a daily basis I am grateful for my family, my real estate team, my clients, the management team at RE/MAX Professionals and of course, the agents who choose to be a part of our brokerage. I wouldn’t be the man I am today without their individual and collective influence in my life – that includes each of you who take the time to read this email every Monday. Thank you. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

A Visit from St. Nicholas Clement Clarke Moore 1779 –1863

'Twas the night before Christmas,<br>when all through the house<br>Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;<br>The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br>In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;<br>The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br>While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;<br>And mamma in her ’kerchief, and I in my cap,<br>Had just settled our brains for a long winter’s nap,<br>When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br>I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.<br>Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br>Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.<br>The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow<br>Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,<br>When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br>But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,<br>With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br>I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.<br>More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,<br>And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;<br>"Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!<br>On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen!<br>To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!<br>Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"<br>As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br>When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;<br>So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,<br>With the sleigh full of Toys, and St. Nicholas too.<br>And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof<br>The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br>As I drew in my head, and was turning around,<br>Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.<br>He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,<br>And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;<br>A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,<br>And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.<br>His eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!<br>His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br>His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow<br>And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;<br>T​​​​he stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<br>And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;<br>He had a broad face and a little round belly,<br>That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly.<br>He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br>And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;<br>A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,<br>Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;<br>He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br>And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,<br>And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br>And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;<br>He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br>And away they all flew like the down of a thistle,<br>But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,<br>"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night."
