**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,196**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! From my family and team, please let us be the first to wish you a day filled with tradition (new and old), laughter, holiday merriment and togetherness. May each package have the perfect bow, each dish have just the right flavor and that you create memories which will live on for years to come. Thank you for being a part of my life. Let’s make it a great day – happy holidays!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Christmas Bells by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

I heard the bells on Christmas Day<br>Their old, familiar carols play, &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>And wild and sweet &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>The words repeat<br>Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

And thought how, as the day had come,<br>The belfries of all Christendom &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Had rolled along &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>The unbroken song<br>Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

Till ringing, singing on its way,<br>The world revolved from night to day, &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>A voice, a chime, &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>A chant sublime<br>Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

Then from each black, accursed mouth<br>The cannon thundered in the South, &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>And with the sound &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>The carols drowned<br>Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

It was as if an earthquake rent<br>The hearth-stones of a continent, &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>And made forlorn &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>The households born<br>Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

And in despair I bowed my head;<br>"There is no peace on earth," I said; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>"For hate is strong, &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>And mocks the song<br>Of peace on earth, good-will to men!"

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:<br>"God is not dead, nor doth He sleep; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>The Wrong shall fail, &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>The Right prevail,<br>With peace on earth, good-will to men.”
