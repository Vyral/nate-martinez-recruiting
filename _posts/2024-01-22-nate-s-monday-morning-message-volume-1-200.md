**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,200**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…I trust that you had a restful and rewarding weekend! We are three weeks into 2024, how is it going so far? I love the story below about the butterfly; its through the struggle that wings are developed. You can’t soar if you avoid the struggle. Even if its difficult, we have to keep going because the end result are beautiful wings. This week I challenge you to embrace the struggle because sometimes the struggle is exactly what we need in our life. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

A young boy once found a butterfly cocoon.

Excited, the boy visited the cocoon every day, to watch the moment when the butterfly would break free.

One day a small crack appeared, and “baby butterfly” was coming to life.

It struggled, trying to force itself through the little hole.

With a pair of scissors, the boy snipped the cocoon open to set the butterfly free.

The butterfly sprawled out, crawled, taking tiny steps but couldn’t take off to the sky.

It’s wings never developed.

What the boy failed to see was the natural evolution of life.

The cocoon is nature’s way of forcing the butterfly to grow wings…

So, it’s ready to fly once it emerges.

Sometimes struggle is exactly what we need in our life.

Without it we wouldn’t be able to spread our wings and fly on our own.
