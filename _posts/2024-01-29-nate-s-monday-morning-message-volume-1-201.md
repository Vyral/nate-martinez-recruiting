**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,201**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…Are you ready to have an amazing week? I shared this quote on my Facebook page a few days ago and I thought it would be good to share with you.

“Most people never get there. They're afraid or unwilling to demand enough of themselves and take the easy road, the path of least resistance. But struggling and suffering, as I now saw it, were the essence of a life worth living. If you're not pushing yourself beyond the comfort zone, if you're not constantly demanding more from yourself—expanding and learning as you go—you're choosing a numb existence. You're denying yourself an extraordinary trip.” - Dean Karnazes

This week I’d like to encourage you to get out of your comfort zone and learn something new that you have been avoiding. Expand your comfort zone by trying something new that terrifies you. Push yourself 1%. You deserve to live an extraordinary life. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Ponderable

Living on the earth is expensive, but it does include a free trip around the sun.

Birthdays are good for you; the more you have the longer you live.

How long a minute is depends on which side of the bathroom door you are on.

I have noticed that the people who are late are often so much jollier than the people who have to wait for them.

Most of us go to our grave with our music still inside us.

You may be only one person in the world, but you may also be the world to one person.

Some mistakes are too much fun to only make once.

Don’t cry because its over; smile because it happened.

We could learn a lot from crayons: some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, some have weird names, and all are different colors…but they all have to learn to live in the same box.

A truly happy person is one who can enjoy the scenery on the detour.

Happiness comes through doors you didn’t even know you left open.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“If you fell down yesterday, stand up today.” - H. G. Wells

“Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.” - Joyce Meyer

“He who is fixed to a star does not change his mind.” - Leonardo da Vinci
