**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,202**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…can you believe it’s the first week of February 2024? Where did January go? I trust that you are having a great start to the New Year! January felt like it just flew by. Did it feel like that for you too? Every day is a choice. A choice on how time will be spent. A choice of what to focus on. Every day is a choice. How will you choose? Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Once a young man asked the wise man, Socrates, the secret to success. Socrates patiently listened to the man’s question and told him to meet him near the river the following day for the answer. So the next day, Socrates asked the young man to walk with him towards the river. As they went in the river, the water got up to their neck. But to the young man’s surprise, Socrates ducked him into the water.

The young man struggled to get out of the water, but Socrates was strong and kept him there until the boy started turning blue. Finally, Socrates pulled the man’s head out of the water. The young man gasped and took a deep breath of air. Socrates asked, ‘What did you want the most when your head was in the water?” The young man replied, “Air.” Socrates said, “That is the secret to success. When you want success as badly as you wanted the air while you were in the water, then you will get it. There is no other secret.”

**Moral of the short story:**

A burning desire is the starting point of all accomplishment. Just like a small fire cannot give much heat, a weak desire cannot produce great results.
