**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,203**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Love is in the air! On this occasion of love and appreciation, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude for Tonya and the special women in my life. Their commitment to our family is truly inspiring, and I feel privileged to share the journey of life with them by my side. Wishing each of you a day filled with joy, warmth, and appreciation. Happy Valentine's Day! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

She Walks in Beauty by Lord Byron (George Gordon)

She walks in beauty, like the night

Of cloudless climes and starry skies;

And all that's best of dark and bright

Meet in her aspect and her eyes;

Thus mellowed to that tender light

Which heaven to gaudy day denies.

One shade the more, one ray the less,

Had half impaired the nameless grace

Which waves in every raven tress,

Or softly lightens o'er her face;

Where thoughts serenely sweet express,

How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.

And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,

So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,

The smiles that win, the tints that glow,

But tell of days in goodness spent,

A mind at peace with all below,

A heart whose love is innocent!



**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“The heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing.” - Blaise Pascal

“Doubt thou the stars are fire, Doubt that the sun doth move. Doubt truth to be a liar, But never doubt I love.” - William Shakespeare

“Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone - we find it with another.” - Thomas Merton
