**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,204**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Today, we are observing President’s Day, which gives us a moment to reflect on the leadership, vision, and dedication of all the presidents who have shaped our nation’s history. On this day, may we honor their contributions to our country’s progress and values. Their collective leadership serves as a reminder of the importance of integrity, empathy, and resilience. May we continue to be inspired by the legacy of past leaders as we navigate the opportunities and responsibilities ahead. Wishing you a meaningful President’s Day. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

If I Were the President, By Skyler T.

If I were the president I would be so happy,<br>And when I travel to the white house guess what I would do,<br>I'd take a swim at the pool,<br>Then would take a shot at the bowling ally,<br>Next I would grow a tree of 100 dollar bills,<br>After that I would build a fountain for people to throw coins in,<br>and after dark I would collect all of that money,<br>Then I would have a sleep over with all of my friends,<br>we would jump on my bed,until we were dead!

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“America was not built on fear. America was built on courage, on imagination and an unbeatable determination to do the job at hand.” - Harry S Truman

“The greatness of America lies not in being more enlightened than any other nation, but rather in her ability to repair her faults.” - Alexis de Tocqueville

“I believe our flag is more than just cloth and ink. It is a universally recognized symbol that stands for liberty, and freedom. It is the history of our nation, and it's marked by the blood of those who died defending it.” - John Thune
