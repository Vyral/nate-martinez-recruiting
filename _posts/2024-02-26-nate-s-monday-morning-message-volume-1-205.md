**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,205**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope you had a refreshing and rewarding weekend. Its hard to believe there are only a few days left in February! How are you feeling so for 2024? We just finished up a 6-week class at our brokerage (some of you reading this were in attendance) and throughout all 11 classes, there was a theme of consistency and action – or consistent action. You can read the best books on the plant, attend seminars (or take classes), mastermind, etc. but without taking action and doing it consistently, the goals won’t be achieved. This week, I’d like to challenge you to take some massive action towards something you want in your life – whether that is a goal or maybe it’s a relationship that needs to be fixed – take action. Don’t sit on the sidelines of life. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Soar Like an Eagle

Did you know that an eagle can foresee when a storm is approaching long before it breaks?

Instead of hiding, the eagle will fly to some high point and wait for the winds to come.

When the storm hits, it sets its wings so that the wind can pick it up and lift it above the storm. While the storm rages below, the eagle soars above it.

The eagle does not escape or hide from the storm; instead, it uses the storm to lift it higher. It rises on the stormy winds which others dread.

When the storm of life or challenges hits us, we can rise above them and soar like the eagle that rides the storm’s winds. Don’t be afraid of the storms or the challenges in your life. Use it to lift you higher in your life.
