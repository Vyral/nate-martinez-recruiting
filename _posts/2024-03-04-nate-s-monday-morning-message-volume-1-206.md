**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,205**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message. I hope this email finds you well and ready for the first week of March 2024! Today I want to talk about failure. Overcoming failure requires resilience, introspection, and a growth mindset. It's crucial to acknowledge and accept failure as a natural part of the learning process, and they are an opportunity for growth rather than a setback. Reflecting on the experience, identifying the factors that contributed to the failure, and learning from mistakes can provide valuable insights for future endeavors. Staying focused on your long-term goals and persevering through setbacks with determination and adaptability are essential for bouncing back from failure. Embrace failure as a steppingstone to success, rather than a roadblock, will empower you to turn adversity into opportunity and emerge stronger, wiser, and more resilient. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Shark Bait

During a research experiment a marine biologist placed a shark into a large holding tank and then released several small bait fish into the tank.

As you would expect, the shark quickly swam around the tank, attacked and ate the smaller fish.

The marine biologist then inserted a strong piece of clear fiberglass into the tank, creating two separate partitions. She then put the shark on one side of the fiberglass and a new set of bait fish on the other.

Again, the shark quickly attacked.&nbsp; This time, however, the shark slammed into the fiberglass divider and bounced off.&nbsp; Undeterred, the shark kept repeating this behavior every few minutes to no avail.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the bait fish swam around unharmed in the second partition.&nbsp; Eventually, about an hour into the experiment, the shark gave up.

This experiment was repeated several dozen times over the next few weeks.&nbsp; Each time, the shark got less aggressive and made fewer attempts to attack the bait fish, until eventually the shark got tired of hitting the fiberglass divider and simply stopped attacking altogether.

The marine biologist then removed the fiberglass divider, but the shark didn’t attack.&nbsp; The shark was trained to believe a barrier existed between it and the bait fish, so the bait fish swam wherever they wished, free from harm.

**The moral:**&nbsp; Many of us, after experiencing setbacks and failures, emotionally give up and stop trying. Like the shark in the story, we believe that because we were unsuccessful in the past, we will always be unsuccessful. In other words, we continue to see a barrier in our heads, even when no ‘real’ barrier exists between where we are and where we want to go.&nbsp;
