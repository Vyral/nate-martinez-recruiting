**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,207**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message. It’s a new week full of new opportunities – are you ready? Today let’s talk about leadership. Leadership is more than just a position; it's a mindset, a set of qualities, and a commitment to guiding and inspiring others towards a common goal. True leadership is characterized by integrity, empathy, vision, and the ability to empower and motivate those around you.

Ultimately, leadership is about serving others, guiding them towards their full potential, and making a positive impact on the world. What do you think makes a good leader? Is it a natural gift or something you can develop? Who is a leader you admire, either dead or alive? I’d love to hear from you! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

It was a beautiful village, there lived a young boy with his parents. He was addicted to eating sugar and his mother warned him several times, not to eat sugar, as it is not good for his health. But the boy didn’t listen to his mother.

After some days, his mother decided to get help from Gandhiji. So, she took his son to the ashram where Gandhiji stayed. The Journey was long, as she has to walk miles in hot weather conditions.

She then finally reached the ashram and met Gandhiji. She asked him to tell her son to stop eating sugar, as it is not good for his health. Gandhiji replied “I cannot tell him that right now but you can bring him back after a month and then I will talk to him!” Hearing this, the mother was confused and upset that Gandhiji didn’t give any solution. She and her son went back home.

After a month, they met Gandhiji again in the Ashram. This time Gandhiji looked at the boy and said “Young boy, you should stop eating sugar as it’s not good for your health. Listen to your mother and follow her.” The boy promised that he will not do that again.

The boy’s mother with curiosity asked Gandhiji “Why didn’t you tell him last time when I bought him here?”

Gandhiji smiled and said, “Mother, last time when you came, I had the habit of eating a lot of sugar myself.”

Moral of the story: If you want to be a leader who wants to be followed or listened to, then you should lead as an example for things that you want others to follow. By leading the way you are creating confidence in people in you.
