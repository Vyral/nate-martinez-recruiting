**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,208**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message. Do you believe in luck? Yesterday while enjoying St. Patrick’s Day, I thought about what it means to be lucky. Is there such a thing? Luck is often associated with chance, however I think that preparation and opportunity play a key role in creating luck. A prepared person is more likely to recognize opportunities and take action which leads to a favorable outcome. My challenge to you this week is to be on the lookout for new opportunities; be ready to seize the moment. Create your own luck. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Penny in the Pocket

One day, on a walk, I noticed a penny on the ground. I didn’t bother to pick it up, and that made me wonder why. Because the sum was so insignificant? I wondered, “What would I do if I found $20? Just keep walking?” Sure enough, I turned the corner and there lay $20. Long story short, I found its owner and returned it with a smile. And then a few hours later, I won $25 on a scratcher. With my pockets a little deeper, I then wondered, “What would I do if I found $1,000,000?” I’ll let you know.—Charlotte Stevens, Ellwood City, Pennsylvania
