**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,209**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message. Last week I celebrated thirty-eight years as a REALTOR® - I didn’t realize it had been so many years until my son pointed it out. As I reflected back, it has been an amazing ride filled with unforgettable moments, countless happy clients, and the privilege of helping people find their dream home. I am truly grateful for the trust and confidence my clients have placed in me over the last thirty-eight years. Each transaction has been a unique opportunity to make a real estate dream a reality, and I couldn't have asked for a more rewarding career.

In addition to selling real estate, I have had the honor of mentoring hundreds of agents across the country – to them I owe a heartfelt appreciation. Your eagerness to learn, grow, and succeed inspires me every day. It's been an honor to share my knowledge and expertise with you, and I'm incredibly proud of all that you've accomplished.

I also want to extend a special thank you to the mentors who have played a pivotal role in shaping my career. Your guidance, wisdom, and unwavering support have been invaluable to me, and I am forever grateful for the lessons you've imparted and the encouragement you've provided.

And last but certainly not least, a huge shoutout to the amazing agents and staff of RE/MAX Professionals. Its mind-blowing to be a part of such a dynamic and dedicated team. Your professionalism, camaraderie, and passion for excellence make every day in the office a joy.

Here's to the power of mentorship, the strength of community, and the endless possibilities that lie ahead. Thank you all for being a part of this incredible journey! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

The Scroll Marked I: Today I begin a new life Today I begin a new life.

Failure will no longer by my payment for my struggle. Just as nature made no provision for my body to tolerate pain neither has it made any provision for my life to suffer failure. Failure, like pain, is alien to my life. In the past I accepted it as I accepted pain. Now I reject it and I am prepared for wisdom and principles which will guide me out of the shadows into the sunlight of wealth, position, and happiness far beyond my most extravagant dreams until even the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides will seem no more than my just reward.

In truth, the only difference between those who have failed and those who have succeeded lies in the differences of their habits. Good habits are the key to all success. Bad habits are the unlocked door to failure. Thus, the first law I will obey, which precedeth all others is – I will form good habits and become their slave.
