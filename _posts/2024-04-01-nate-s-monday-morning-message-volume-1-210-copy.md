**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,211**

Volume 1,211

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message. I hope you had a great weekend! Have you ever found yourself in a situation where communication was a challenge? I know I certainly have! Let’s unpack this a little more. Effective communication is key to building strong relationships, yet it is a struggle for many.

To communicate effectively, it's essential to actively listen, speak clearly and respectfully, and convey your message in a way that resonates with the person you are talking to. Its also important to be open to their perspectives and to show empathy. Additionally, be receptive to feedback, ask clarifying questions, and strive to maintain open lines of communication. By practicing active listening, clear expression, and empathy, you can enhance your communication skills and foster meaningful connections with those you care about in your life. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

The Scroll Marked III: I will persist until I succeed.

I was not delivered unto this world in defeat, nor does failure course in my veins. I am not a sheep waiting to be prodded by my shepherd. I am a lion and I refuse to talk, to walk, to sleep with the sheep. I will not hear those who weep and complain, for their disease is contagious. Let them join the sheep. The slaughterhouse of failure is not my destiny. I will persist until I succeed.

I will never consider defeat and I will remove from my vocabulary such words and phrases as quit, cannot, unable, impossible, out of the question, improbable, failure, unworkable, hopeless, and retreat; for they are the words of fools. I will avoid despair but if this disease of the mind should infect me then I will work on in despair. I will toil and I will endure. I will ignore the obstacles at my feet and keep mine eyes on the goals above my head, for I know that where dry desert ends, green grass grows.

I will persist until I succeed. Nor will I allow yesterday's success to lull me into today's complacency, for this is the great foundation of failure. I will forget the happenings of the day that is gone, whether they were good or bad, and greet the new sun with confidence that this will be the best day of my life. So long as there is breath in me, that long will I persist. For now I know one of the greatest principles of success; if I persist long enough I will win.

I will persist. I will win.
