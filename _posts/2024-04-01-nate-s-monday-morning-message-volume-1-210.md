**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,210**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message. I hope this email finds you rejuvenated from a joyful Easter weekend! I enjoy the closeness that is felt on Easter, and remember the traditions passed down along the way with my family. As we welcome the arrival of spring, let's embrace the spirit of renewal and hope – and take time to reflect on the first quarter of 2024. What went right? What can be improved? How do you leverage the next three months to keep you on track for the life you want to live? I’d love to hear from you! Shoot me an email – how are you feeling about this year so far? Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

The Scroll Marked II: I will greet this day with love in my heart.

I will greet this day with love in my heart. For this is the greatest secret of success in all ventures. Muscle can split a shield and even destroy life but only the unseen power of love can open the hearts of men and until I master this art I will remain no more than a peddler in the market place. I will make love my greatest weapon and none on whom I call can defend against its force.

And how will I confront each whom I meet? In only one way. In silence and to myself I will address him and say I Love You. Though spoken in silence these words will shine in my eyes, unwrinkle my brow, bring a smile to my lips, and echo in my voice; and his heart will be opened. And who is there who will say nay to my goods when his hearts feels my love? I will greet this day with love in my heart.

I will greet this day with love in my heart. Henceforth will I love all mankind. From this moment all hate is let from my veins for I have not time to hate, only time to love. From this moment I take the first step required to become a man among men. With love I will increase my sales a hundred-fold and become a great salesman. If I have no other qualities I can succeed with love alone. Without it I will fail though I possess all the knowledge and skills of the world. I will greet this day with love, and I will succeed.
