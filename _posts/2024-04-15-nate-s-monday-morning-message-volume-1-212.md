**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,212**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message. Welcome to a new week – and its Tax Day! I know most self-employed people dread paying taxes, however I am actually not one of them. I am grateful every year to pay taxes because I understand the impact I get to make with the money I pay.

Expressing gratitude for taxes can be a perspective-shifting practice that acknowledges the importance of contributing to the well-being of society. While taxes may seem like a burden, they also serve as a means of supporting vital public services and infrastructure that benefit us all. From education and healthcare to transportation and public safety, taxes play a crucial role in building and maintaining a thriving community.

By reframing our view of taxes and expressing gratitude for the opportunity to contribute – makes Tax Day, a great day. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

The Scroll Marked IIII:

I am nature’s greatest miracle. Since the beginning of time never has there been another with my mind, my heart, my eyes, my ears, my hands, my hair, my mouth. None that came before, none that live today, and none that come tomorrow can walk and talk and move and think exactly like me. All men are my brothers yet I am different from each. I am a unique creature.

I am nature’s greatest miracle.

I am rare, and there is value in all rarity; therefore, I am valuable. I am the end product of thousands of years of evolution; therefore, I am better equipped in both mind and body than all the emperors and wise men who preceded me. But my skills, my mind, my heart, and my body will stagnate, rot, and die lest I put them to good use. I have unlimited potential. Only a small portion of my brain do I employ; only a paltry amount of muscles do I flex.

A hundredfold or more can I increase my accomplishments of yesterday and this I will do, beginning today. I am nature’s greatest miracle. No beast, no plant, no wind, no rain, no rock, no lake had the same beginning as I, for I was conceived in love and brought forth with a purpose. In the past I have not considered this fact but it will henceforth shape and guide my life.

I am nature’s greatest miracle.
