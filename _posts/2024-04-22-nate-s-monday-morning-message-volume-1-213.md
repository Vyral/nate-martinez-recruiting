**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,213**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message. I hope you had a wonderful weekend and that you found some time to relax, recoup and refresh. Its hard to believe the month of April is nearly over – this spring has flown by! Have you ever given up on a goal or a dream? Have you stopped trying because you got rejected? Do you think your ideas are unrealistic or impossible? There are two ways to overcome rejection – the first is to know your outcome and stick to it like your life depends on it (because it does). The second is to change your approach. If you hear no, say it another way. Go deep with the perceived rejection and keep changing your approach until you get the answer you seek.

Stay persistent. Don't let rejection discourage you from pursuing your goals and dreams. Use it as fuel to drive your motivation and determination to succeed. Stay focused on your objectives (know your outcome), keep pushing forward, and remain open to new opportunities that may arise along the way. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

The Scroll Marked V:

I will live this day as if it is my last.

And what shall I do with this last precious day, which remains I my keeping? First, I will seal up its container of life so that not one drop spills itself upon the sand. I will waste not a moment mourning yesterday’s misfortunes, yesterday’s defeats, yesterday’s aches of the heart, for why should I throw good after bad?

I will live this day as if it is my last.

And if it is my last, it will be my greatest monument. This day I will make the best day of my life. This day I will drink every minute to its full. I will savor its taste and give thanks. I will maketh every hour count and each minute. I will trade only for something of value. I will labor harder than ever before and push my muscles until they cry for relief, and then I will continue. I will make more calls than ever before. I will sell more goods than ever before. I will earn more gold than ever before. Each minute of today will be more fruitful than hours of yesterday. My last must be my best. I will live this day as if it is my last. And if it is not, I shall fall to my knees and give thanks.
