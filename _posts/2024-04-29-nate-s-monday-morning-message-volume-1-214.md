**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,214**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! It’s a new week full of new opportunities – are you ready? I hope this email gets your week started! Have you ever been afraid? Nervous or uncertain? Overcoming fear requires a combination of self-awareness, courage, and perseverance. Start by acknowledging and identifying the source of your fear, whether it's a specific situation, outcome, or unknown factor. Once you understand what you're afraid of, challenge your fear by reframing it as an opportunity for growth and learning.

Practice mindfulness techniques such as deep breathing, visualization, or positive affirmations to calm your mind and center yourself in the present moment. Surround yourself with supportive friends, family, or mentors who can offer encouragement and guidance as you face your fears. Remember that it's okay to feel afraid, but it's important not to let fear hold you back from pursuing your goals and dreams. By confronting your fears with courage and determination, you can overcome them and unlock your full potential. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

The Scroll Marked VI:

Today I will be master of emotions.

And how will I master my emotions so that every day is a happy day, and a productive one? I will learn this secret of the ages: Weak is he who permits his thoughts to control his actions; strong is he who forces his actions to control his thoughts. Each day, when I awake, I will follow this plan of battle before I am captured by the forces of sadness, self-pity and failure – <br>• If I feel depressed, I will sing. <br>• If I feel sad, I will laugh. <br>• If I feel ill, I will double my labor. <br>• If I feel fear, I will plunge ahead. <br>• If I feel inferior, I will wear new garments. <br>• If I feel uncertain, I will raise my voice. <br>• If I feel poverty, I will think of wealth to come. <br>• If I feel incompetent, I will remember past success. <br>• If I feel insignificant, I will remember my goals.

Today I will be master of my emotions.
