**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,216**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well and ready for the new week that is ahead of us. Have you ever found yourself hanging on to something that hurt you? Or something you wish had been different? Letting go is a transformative act of self-liberation, allowing us to release the weight of the past and embrace the possibilities of the present. It's about relinquishing control, surrendering to the flow of life, and trusting in the inherent wisdom we will gain by the experience. By letting go of resentment, regret, and expectations, we create space for forgiveness, healing, and growth. It's a journey of self-discovery and empowerment, where we learn to release attachments, fears, and limiting beliefs that no longer serve us. Letting go is not about giving up or forgetting, but rather about accepting what is, finding peace within ourselves, and moving forward with courage, grace, and gratitude for the lessons learned along the way. Is there something you need to let go of? Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

The Scroll Marked VIII:

Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold.

I am liken to a grain of wheat which faces one of three futures. The wheat can be placed in a sack and dumped in a stall until it is fed to swine. Or it can be ground to flour and made into bread. Or it can be placed in the earth and allowed to grow until its golden head divides and produces a thousand grains from the one.

I am liken to a grain of wheat with one difference. The wheat cannot choose whether it be fed to swine, ground for bread, or planted to multiply. I have a choice and I will not let my life be fed to swine and despair to be broken open and devoured by the will of others. Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold.

The height of my goals will not hold me in awe though I may stumble often before they are reached. If I stumble I will rise and my falls will not concern me for all men must stumble often to reach the hearth. Only a worm is free from the worry of stumbling. I am not a worm. I am not an onion plant. I am not a sheep. I am a man. Let others build a cave with their clay. I will build a castle with mine. Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold.
