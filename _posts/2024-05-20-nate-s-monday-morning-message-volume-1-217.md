**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,217**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! How was your weekend? Did you have some time to rest, reflect and refresh? Today I want to talk about gratitude. How do you practice gratitude? Its impossible to feel down and out when you are in gratitude. How deep do you go with gratitude? I met a guy who shared his thoughts on gratitude for a shower. As he talked, he went deep – his gratitude included the folks who made the parts for the shower, the people who work for the water company, the trenches that supply the water to the house – I could go on about who he described his gratitude – but I think you get the point. He wasn’t just grateful for the water that comes out of the faucet every morning! It shifted my perspective on how to practice gratitude and that it is so much more than the convenience of hot water. It’s a profound recognition and appreciation for the blessings, big and small, that enrich our lives each day. Gratitude fills our hearts with joy, kindness, and generosity, fostering deeper connections with ourselves, others, and the world around us. Practicing gratitude opens the door to a deeper sense of fulfillment and purpose, reminding us to pause, reflect, and savor the richness of life's experiences. What are you grateful for? Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

The Scroll Marked XI: I will act now.

My dreams are worthless, my plans are dust, my goals are impossible. All are of no value unless they are followed by action.

I will act now.

My procrastination which has held me back was born of fear and now I recognize this secret mined from the depths of courageous hearts. Now I know that to conquer fear I must always act without hesitation and the flutters in my heart will vanish. Now I know that action reduces the lion of terror to an ant of equanimity.

I will not avoid the tasks of today and charge them to tomorrow for I know that tomorrow never comes. Let me act now even though my actions may not bring happiness or success for it is better to act and fail than not to act and flounder. Happiness, in truth, may not be the fruit plucked by my action yet without action all fruit will die on the vine. I will act now.

I will act now. When the lion is hungry he eats. When the eagle has thirst he drinks. Lest they act, both will perish. I hunger for success. I thirst for happiness and peace of mind. Lest I act I will perish in a life of failure, misery, and sleepless nights. I will command, and I will obey mine own command. I will act now. Success will not wait. If I delay she will become betrothed to another and lost to me forever. This is the time. This is the place. I am the man. I will act now.
