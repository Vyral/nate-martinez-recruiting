**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,218**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! On this Memorial Day, we pause to honor and remember the brave men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country. Their courage, dedication, and unwavering commitment to protecting our freedoms stand as a profound testament to the true spirit of patriotism. As we gather with family and friends, let us reflect on the true cost of our liberty and express our deepest gratitude to those who have given their lives for our great nation. Today, we remember their legacy and pledge to uphold the values they fought to defend. May their sacrifice never be forgotten, and may we always strive to live in a way that honors their memory. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

The Scroll Marked X: I will pray for guidance

I will pray for guidance, and I will pray as a salesman, in this manner –

•Oh creator of all things, help me. For this day I go out into the world naked and alone, and without your hand to guide me I will wander far from the path which leads to success and happiness.

• I ask not for gold or garments or even opportunities equal to my ability; instead, guide me so that I may acquire ability equal to my opportunities.

• You have taught the lion and the eagle how to hunt and prosper with teeth and claw. Teach me how to hunt with words and prosper with love so that I may be a lion among men and an eagle in the market place.

• Help me to remain humble through obstacles and failures; yet hide not from mine eyes the prize that will come with victory.

• Assign me tasks to which others have failed; yet guide me to pluck the seeds of success from their failures. Confront me with fears that will temper my spirit; yet endow me with courage to laugh at my misgivings.

• Spare me sufficient days to reach my goals; yet help me to live this day as though it be my last.

• Guide me in my words that they may bear fruit; yet silence me from gossip that none be maligned.

• Discipline me in the habit of trying and trying again; yet show me the way to make use of the law of averages. Favor me with alertness to recognize opportunity; yet endow me with patience which will concentrate my strength.

• Bathe me in good habits that the bad ones may drown; yet grant me compassion for weakness in others. Suffer me to know that all things shall pass; yet help me to count my blessings today.

• Expose me to hate so it not be a stranger; yet fill my cup with love to turn strangers into friends.

• But all these things be only if thy will. I am a small and a lonely grape clutching the vine yet though hast made me different from all others. Verily, there must be a special place for me. Help me. Show me the way.

• Let me become all you planned for me when my seed was planted and selected by you to sprout in the vineyard of the world. Help this humble salesman.

“My fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.” - John F. Kennedy<br>
