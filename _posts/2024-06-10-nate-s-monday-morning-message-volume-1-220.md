**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,220**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope you had a relaxing and fulfilling weekend and you are ready for summer temps, because they are here in the Valley of the Sun! Today, I’d like to talk about habits, and specifically how we create good, healthy habits that support our goals and desired lifestyle.

Creating new habits involves a combination of intention, consistency, and patience. Start by identifying a specific habit you want to develop and understand the motivation behind it, ensuring it aligns with your goals and values. Break the habit into small, manageable steps and incorporate it into your daily routine at a consistent time and place to build familiarity and reduce resistance.

Use reminders and cues to prompt the behavior, and track your progress to stay motivated and accountable. Be patient with yourself, as forming a new habit takes time and persistence; setbacks are a natural part of the process. Celebrate small victories along the way to reinforce positive behavior and gradually integrate the habit into your lifestyle, transforming it into a natural and sustainable part of your daily life.

What habits do you want to create or change? I’d love to hear from you- let’s hold each other accountable! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

The Cat and the Fire

I was deploying overseas so I decided to leave my black cat with my mother. My mother had been feeling alone lately, and I hoped he would change that. After two years, I was ready to get him back. Before I could do that, I got a call from my mother. She said she had fallen asleep earlier and woke up to him on her chest, meowing and pushing her face. He had never done that before. She smelled something funny, jumped out of bed, and found the kitchen on fire. My mom is alive because of him. He’s hers now! - Helen Jones, Pflugerville, Texas

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“In truth, the only difference between those who have failed and those who have succeeded lies in the difference of their habits. Good habits are the key to all success. Bad habits are the unlocked door to failure. Thus, the first law I will obey, which precedeth all others is – I will form good habits and become their slave.” – Og Mandino<br><br>“Self-respect is the fruit of discipline; the sense of dignity grows with the ability to say no to oneself.” - Abraham Joshua Heschel

“Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.” - Mahatma Gandhi
