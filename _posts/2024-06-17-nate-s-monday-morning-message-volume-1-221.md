**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,221**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Did you have a good weekend? I hope you are ready for the new week! One of my favorite mentors used to tell me, “Get out of judgement and into curiosity.” That got me thinking about today’s message…

Curiosity is a powerful driving force that fuels our desire to explore, learn, and understand the world around us – from a different perspective. It can ignite our imagination, prompting us to ask qualifying questions, seek out new experiences, and delve into the unknown. Curiosity pushes us beyond our comfort zones and encourages personal growth. It fosters innovation and creativity by challenging the status quo.

And lastly, curiosity enhances our relationships by deepening our empathy and understanding of others. Embracing curiosity leads to a richer, more fulfilling life, as it opens up endless possibilities and opportunities. Next time you are faced with a challenge, I’d like to encourage you to come from a space of curiosity – instead of jumping into judgment, ask the question, “Oh, please tell me more about that.” Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Found Money at the Grocery Store

I was third in line at the checkout, and the lady at the cashier was purchasing basic items. Two cans of cat food, a can of tuna, a loaf of bread, a quart of milk, a package of cookies. Her money was in her hand as the cashier gave her the total. She was 86 cents short. She checked her purse to no avail. “I can put something back,” she said. The man ahead of me reached into his pocket, palmed a dollar, bent down as if to pick something up, and said, “I think you dropped this.”—*Michael F. Heberger, East Rochester, New York*
