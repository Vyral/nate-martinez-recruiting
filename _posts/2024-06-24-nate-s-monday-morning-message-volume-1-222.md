**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,222**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope you had a relaxing and rewarding weekend – ready for the last week of June? Does it feel like the year is flown by for you? We had an exciting week, as we welcomed our fifth grandbaby into the family – Sofia Gray Martinez was born on June 13th. We couldn’t be any prouder of our son Nate Jr and his wonderful wife, Ashley. They gave us such an incredible gift with our second granddaughter. Being a dad has always been one of my greatest accomplishments, however, being a grandfather is in a completely different stratosphere. Children have a unique way of putting life into perspective – and for me, they remind me that family is everything. Please help me congratulate Nate Jr and his family – welcome to the world Sophia! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Penny in the Pocket

One day, on a walk, I noticed a penny on the ground. I didn’t bother to pick it up, and that made me wonder why. Because the sum was so insignificant? I wondered, “What would I do if I found $20? Just keep walking?” Sure enough, I turned the corner and there lay $20. Long story short, I found its owner and returned it with a smile. And then a few hours later, I won $25 on a scratcher. With my pockets a little deeper, I then wondered, “What would I do if I found $1,000,000?” I’ll let you know.” — *C. Stevens, Ellwood City, Pennsylvania*
