**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,223**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope you had a wonderful weekend, and you are staying hydrated and embracing the monsoon season – we never complain about the rain in the Valley of the Sun! We have a short week coming up with the holiday on Thursday – how do you plan to celebrate our great country’s Independence Day? July Fourth is a special day for many reasons – it’s a day that serves as a reminder of the values of freedom, democracy, and unity that the United States was founded upon. It's a time for reflection on the nation's history, honoring those who have fought for its independence, and celebrating the enduring spirit of the American people. I hope you will take a moment to reflect on what it means to celebrate the 4th of July. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

The Star-Spangled Banner

Say, can you see<br>By the dawn's early light<br>What so proudly we hailed<br>At the twilight's last gleaming?

Whose broad stripes and bright stars<br>Through the perilous fight<br>O'er the ramparts we watched<br>Were so gallantly, yeah, streaming?

And the rockets' red glare<br>The bombs bursting in air<br>Gave proof through the night<br>That our flag was still there

O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave<br>O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“We must be free not because we claim freedom, but because we practice it.” - William Faulkner

“Freedom is the open window through which pours the sunlight of the human spirit and human dignity.” - Herbert Hoover

“The Fourth of July should be celebrated with big hearts.” - Camila Alves
