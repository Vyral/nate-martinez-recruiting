**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,224**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope you are rested and ready for the first week of July! I was blessed to spend some time with my family in beautiful Newport Beach, CA last week, which got me thinking about the importance of having fun. How much time do you spend having fun?

Having fun is essential for maintaining a healthy and balanced life. It acts as a counterbalance to the stresses and responsibilities that come with our daily routines, allowing us to recharge and refresh our minds and bodies. Engaging in enjoyable activities encourages creativity and enhances our overall well-being by releasing endorphins, the body's natural feel-good chemicals. Fun experiences also strengthen relationships – there is nothing better than bonding and creating memories with family and friends.

Making time for fun helps to have a positive outlook on life and promotes a sense of fulfillment and happiness. Next time you think about having fun, remember its not just a leisurely activity, but a critical component to living a healthy and happy life. What fun things are you doing this summer? I’d love to hear from you! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Help from Claire

While shopping, I noticed a credit card on the floor. I picked it up, went to the courtesy desk, and asked them to page the owner. I waited. No one came. They said that her cart was still there and she had gone out to her car to look for her card. When she came back, I approached her and asked if she lost something. She did, her credit card. I asked her name and established that it matched the card, which I then gave her. She said she had prayed to her mother, who had passed away recently, to help her find the card. We talked and I introduced myself. “My name is Claire,” I said. She responded, “My mother’s name was Claire.”—Claire Salem, New City, New York
