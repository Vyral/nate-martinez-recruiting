**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,225**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…I hope you are staying hydrated with these crazy summer temps! I saw this quote last week, which has inspired today’s message:

“He is happiest, be he king or peasant, who finds peace in his home.” - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

There are two elements to this quote that resonate with me – and maybe its because I help people with real estate – but the importance of “home” in relation to our ability to achieve peace in life. A “home” is so much more than just a roof over your head – in incorporates our relationships, our financial stability, our health and overall since of self-worth and pride.

Finding peace in your home is about creating a sanctuary that reflects tranquility and harmony, providing a respite from the stresses of the outside world. Establishing routines for relaxation, whether it's a quiet morning coffee, a dip in the pool or a cozy corner for reading, helps to anchor your day – and find peace. Ultimately, a peaceful home is a place where you can find balance, and connect with yourself and your loved ones, create memories that last a lifetime while fostering a sense of well-being and contentment.

How do you find peace in your home? I’d love to hear from you. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Like Son, Like Father

Caught in a sudden downpour on the last day of a bike-packing trip, I ducked into the lobby of a nearby supermarket for cover. As I waited out the storm with my bicycle and gear, a teenage boy invited me to spend the night with his family. I gladly accepted, and he went to find his parents. While I waited, an older man made me the same offer. I thanked him and said I already had a place to stay. Shortly after, the boy returned with his parents. The man who had approached me was his father.—Philip Wood, Orlando, Florida
