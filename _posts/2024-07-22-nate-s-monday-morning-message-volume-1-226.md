**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,226**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…I can’t believe that its almost August! And that means we are rapidly approaching our Month of Miracles fundraising event that benefits our Phoenix Children’s and now that we have an office in Tucson, that includes the Tucson Medical Center. This year we are hosting a comedy show followed by the live auction we have done for the past several years. To date, our office has raised more than $750,000 and it makes us so proud to know that our efforts helped to build the new campus that is opening in Arrowhead Ranch next week. I’d like to invite you to join us for a worthy cause, that will be a fun night too. You can scan the QR below to get your tickets or you can [click here](https://funtimesatpros.yapsody.com/event/book/814167/31681063){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. We have a lofty goal of $50,000 for this year’s Month of Miracles! I hope you’ll join us on August 16th, 2024. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

RE/MAX® is built on a culture of giving. For 31 years, we’ve partnered with Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals to positively change the health of kids and their families. The RE/MAX Miracle Home & Miracle Property Program empowers RE/MAX agents and offices to support their local children’s hospital. By designating their listing as a Miracle Home or Property, agents will donate on behalf of their clients with each home sale, with 100% of the donation benefiting their local children’s hospital.

Since 1992, RE/MAX affiliates in the U.S. and Canada have donated nearly $200 million to Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals.

Like most nonprofits, children’s hospitals rely on donations. The fact is more kids need the specialized care that children’s hospitals provide than can afford it. Since 1992, support from RE/MAX has helped children’s hospitals provide best-in-class medical treatment and services that help patient families identify and receive the care they need. For decades, RE/MAX affiliates have found unique and creative ways to engage their Associates and clients -- through community events, volunteerism, and fundraising efforts.
