**Nate's Monday Morning Message Volume 1,229**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Change is in the air – can you feel it? There are changes in the economy, interest rates, the election, the stock market and the real estate industry. Let’s unpack this a little more.

Embracing change is a vital aspect of growth, development and vision for the future. Change offers opportunities to have a new perspective and a new experience. While change can be daunting, if we approach it with an open mind and a positive attitude, we will navigate unchartered waters easier.

By viewing change as an opportunity rather than a threat, we can harness its potential to improve our lives, our industries, and continuously evolve for a bright future – and especially how people buy and sell real estate with the new changes. If you have any questions on how these changes may impact you, or your buying/selling experience, please reach out. I’d love to have a conversation with you. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

“At age 53, I opened my own restaurant.” —Brad Gold, 72, Los Angeles, CA

“When I got laid off at 53 from a senior management position with a struggling restaurant chain, I knew it was going to be hard to find another job in the corporate world. I also knew it was now or never to pursue my lifelong dream of owning my own restaurant. What was most daunting was that, in order to make this happen, I was going to need to find an existing café that was underperforming and whose owner was highly motivated to get out of his lease. I got very lucky and found just what I wanted eight blocks from home. Since I had never financially planned for this day, I had to borrow money from friends and relatives. I changed the name to [Black Dog Coffee](https://www.blackdogcoffee.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, the menu, the recipes and the look of the cafe, and my wife did a great job of ‘designing on a dime.’ Eighteen years later, we’re still here and doing better than ever. I’m eternally grateful for the layoff and the opportunity to pursue my dream.”
