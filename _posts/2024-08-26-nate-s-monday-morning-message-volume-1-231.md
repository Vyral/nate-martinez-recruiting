**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,231**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Are you ready for the last week of August, 2024? Today I want to talk about leadership. Last week I got to see leadership in action with the Month of Miracles committee who put on an excellent fundraising event for CMN. What does it mean to be a good leader?

To be a good leader, start by leading with empathy and integrity, understanding the needs and aspirations of your team. Communicate clearly and listen actively, creating an environment where everyone feels valued and heard. Set a strong example by demonstrating the qualities you wish to see in others—commitment, resilience, and a willingness to learn. Encourage collaboration and innovation, empowering your team to take ownership of their work and grow alongside you. A good leader also provides guidance and support, recognizing and celebrating achievements while offering constructive feedback to help others improve. Ultimately, being a good leader means inspiring trust and motivating others to reach their full potential, driving the team toward shared success.

Are you a natural leader? Who are your favorite leaders (current or past)? I’d love to hear from you! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

**Model T Ford**

Climate entrepreneur Shayna Rector-Bleeker told a great little story on my podcast recently, about the challenge of inspiring fleet managers to get into electric vehicles.

Don't get daunted by this. We've done this before. A hundred years ago, we had a lot of horse and buggies going around. Then this thing called the Model T Ford showed up. And people thought this was going to be fringe, you know, I'm used to figuring where's the pub and where's the place to feed my horse? Within a decade, the majority of transportation had shifted over and this incredible new infrastructure – gas stations and all of these things – had come to be that seemed impossible at the beginning. Yet it happened, and this is what we're doing again now.
