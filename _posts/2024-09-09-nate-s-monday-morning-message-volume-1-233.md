**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,233**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Welcome the football season – just like a game, we are in the fourth quarter which got me thinking about a concept of “good, better, best.” When this concept is applied to personal development and growth, you will see the importance of continuous improvement and striving for excellence. It starts with acknowledging where you are - what’s good in your current skills, habits, and mindset. From there, the focus shifts to better - identifying areas for improvement, setting higher goals, and pushing beyond comfort zones to enhance your abilities and expand your perspective. Finally, aiming for the best involves not just reaching a personal peak but consistently surpassing it, maintaining a mindset of lifelong learning and self-mastery. This progression cultivates resilience, adaptability, and a proactive approach to life, encouraging us to not settle for mediocrity - and to always pursue our highest potential, living life with purpose and intention. What are you going to do to focus on doing better in Q4? Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Wrong Number

I answered a ringing pay phone—a call meant for another. I was enamored by the angelic voice of the girl on the other end of the line, and we spoke for what seemed like hours. She was from Iowa, I from Florida, and I was spending the summer in New Mexico’s mountains. I immediately knew that I wanted to know more about her. We exchanged letters and became pen pals. Six months later, I traveled to the Midwest to meet my mystery girl. It was love at first sight. In September, we will celebrate our 30th anniversary.—*Randy Aronson, Cooper City, Florida*

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible.” - T. E. Lawrence

“The soul should always stand ajar, ready to welcome the ecstatic experience.” - Emily Dickinson

“My dear friend, clear your mind of can’t.” - Samuel Johnson
