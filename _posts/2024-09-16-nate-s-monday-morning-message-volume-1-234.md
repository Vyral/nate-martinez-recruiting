**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,234**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well and ready for cooler temperatures in the Valley of the Sun! Have you ever had a time in your life when you’ve need intestinal fortitude? I know I have, which got me thinking about this email today. Intestinal fortitude, or inner courage, in life is about pushing through tough times with grit and unwavering resolve. It's the strength that drives you to keep going when faced with adversity, obstacles, or fear. This kind of resilience comes from deep within, enabling you to tackle challenges head-on, stay true to your values, and persevere when the road gets tough. With intestinal fortitude, you can overcome self-doubt and hardships, emerging stronger and more confident in your ability to face whatever life throws your way. It’s about courage in the face of struggle and growth through perseverance. I’d love to hear about a time you had to use intestinal fortitude! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

SS Serendipity

In July 1915, Henry and his eight-year-old daughter, Pearl, were excited for the company outing the next day. That evening, Henry had a violent argument with his landlord, ending with the landlord spitting on a painting of the Virgin Mary. Henry was so upset, he fell ill and canceled their trip. He and Pearl missed the cruise on the SS Eastland, which sank with over 800 people on board—but not my future grandfather and mother. Thanks to that miracle argument 100 years ago, 22 descendants are alive today.—*Vernon Magneseen, Elmhurst, Illinois*
