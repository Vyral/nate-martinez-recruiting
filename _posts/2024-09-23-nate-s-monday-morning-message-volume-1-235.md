**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,235**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope this email finds you ready for the last week of September and maybe cooler temps are on their way! Did you hear the news last week? Yes, its true that the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by .5% which is a quarter percent more than we anticipated. We don’t know exactly how this will impact interest rates for mortgages; however, this is good news in general for affordability. Just last week, our team at Motto Mortgage locked a buyer in below 6% which we haven’t seen in months. And just today I got an email from a Valley home builder who is offering 1.99% interest rate which is fantastic! If you are an agent in my brokerage, I would encourage you to get with your favorite lender and then share that information with your family, friends and clients. If you are reading this as a client, please reach out to learn more about your buying power today – with nearly 20,000 homes on the market today, there are amazing opportunities in homeownership. I look forward to hearing from you soon! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

An Angel with a Donut

Several years ago, my tire went flat while I was driving with my young son asleep in the backseat. It was a heavily traveled road, so I pulled over. I looked in my rearview mirror and saw that a man had pulled up behind me. He offered to help. As he installed the donut, we talked. He explained that he was from a long distance away. His face was kind, his voice gentle. My son awoke, and I went to care for him. When I looked back, the man was gone. Do angels walk the earth? I believe they do.—*Mary Beth Asenio, Timberlake, Ohio*
