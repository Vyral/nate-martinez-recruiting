**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,237**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! This week I want to talk about our health – specifically when it comes to how we advocate for our health.

Advocating for yourself in regard to your health is essential to ensure you receive the care and attention you deserve. It means speaking up, asking questions, and being proactive about your well-being. By understanding your body and your needs, you can make informed decisions, collaborate with your healthcare providers, and seek second opinions when necessary. If something feels off, it probably is and don’t make the mistake of just “toughing” through it.

When you get on an airplane, they tell you to put your oxygen mask on first before assisting people around you – there is a reason for this. You can’t help those traveling with you if you can’t breathe. Self-care and advocating for your health means you will be around longer for those who care about you!

Do you have any health tips you’d like to share? I’d love to hear them! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

An Angel with a Donut

Several years ago, my tire went flat while I was driving with my young son asleep in the backseat. It was a heavily traveled road, so I pulled over. I looked in my rearview mirror and saw that a man had pulled up behind me. He offered to help. As he installed the donut, we talked. He explained that he was from a long distance away. His face was kind, his voice gentle. My son awoke, and I went to care for him. When I looked back, the man was gone. Do angels walk the earth? I believe they do.—*Mary Beth Asenio, Timberlake, Ohio*
