**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,238**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! How was your week? Are the cooler temps on their way? Last week I wrote to you about health and this week I want to continue that theme but with a slight twist. In January I joined a group of men who agreed to stand on a stage to document their weight loss journey and have photos taken. While I am not exactly where I want to be, I am still proud of my progress and despite some setbacks like getting pneumonia and suffering a foot injury, I have shed 20 pounds, and I feel great. If I keep up the efforts, I should be in the best shape of my life by my 65th birthday in December! It doesn’t matter what you do, as long as you have consistency – daily progress – towards your goals, you will have success. And this applies to anything in your life – health, work, relationships – whatever it is for you. It’s the commitment to yourself that wins. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Two Hunters

Two hunters had rented an airplane to get to the distant forest zone. After a couple of weeks the pilot returned to take them back. After looking at their hunting trophies he said: “The plane won’t be able to carry more than one buffalo. You will have to leave one of them.”

“But last year the pilot agreed to take on board two buffalos the same size as these,” the hunters protested. The pilot thought about it and said: “Ok. If it worked the last year, it should work this time too.”

The plane tried to take off with two passengers and two buffalos on board, but it was not able to reach the required height. The plane crashed into the nearest hill. After getting out the plane wreck, the hunters looked around. One of them said to another: “Where do you think we are?”

His pal examined the surroundings and answered: “I think we are two miles south from the place that we crashed the last time.”
