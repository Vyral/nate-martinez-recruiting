**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,244**

This Thanksgiving, we celebrate the spirit of gratitude – a time to reflect on the blessings in our lives and the people who make them meaningful. As we gather with family and friends, let’s remember the importance of expressing thanks for the big and small moments that bring joy to our days. I am especially grateful for the opportunity to connect with and serve such an incredible community.

May your Thanksgiving be filled with warmth, happiness, and all the comforts of the season. Wishing you and your loved one’s health, happiness, and cherished memories. Let’s make it a great week!

Fun Facts about Thanksgiving Day!

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates that Americans eat more than 46 million turkeys on Thanksgiving each year. This is based on the fact that about 88% of Americans consume turkey on Thanksgiving.

What is the second most consumed food on Thanksgiving? Mashed potatoes! The yummy, buttery, sometimes cheesy or garlicky dish takes the plate for the 2nd most popular. With 250 million pounds of potatoes in every variety used every thanksgiving.

According to the poll, in which participants were asked about their holiday likes and dislikes, cranberry sauce was the ranked least favorite Thanksgiving side dish among 27 per cent of adults. Green bean casserole was runner-up, with 25 per cent of participants saying it was their least favorite dish.

A 1653 French cookbook contained one of the earliest recipes of a “pumpkin pie” where milk-boiled pumpkins were strained and baked in a crust. While recipes in the late 17th century in both England and New England described filling a hollowed-out pumpkin with sweetened milk or sliced apples and cooking it in a fire.

The most popular thing to watch on Thanksgiving is an American football game. This tradition has been around for over a century. Some families may even split into teams to play football themselves.
