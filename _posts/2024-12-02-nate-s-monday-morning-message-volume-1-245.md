**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,245**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! And I will also say – Welcome December! Here we are with the final four weeks of the year – and the holiday hustle has already begun. Many business owners wind down things in the final weeks and I’d like to challenge you to reconsider that approach. While its important to spend quality time with your loved ones and create last memories during this special time, there is also importance to setting up the new year for a winning outcome.

I heard this phrase the other day – “if you don’t have clarity in the beginning, you’ll have confusion at the end.” Wow – how true – and how many areas of live and business this applies to!?! Now is the time to create clarity for the life you want to live. The holidays grant us the time to reflect, have gratitude and believe in the magic of the traditions we love to celebrate. How do you apply that to your life all year?

I am here to support you – whether that is buying or selling a home, or your business goals as a REALTOR® or other business owner. I’d love to hear from you - Let’s make it a great week!

PS You are invited! We are excited to share that Master Coach and RE/MAX Team Leader, Cleve Gaddis will be joining us for our December Business Meeting to share: The Five Things You Should Do Starting Now to Create Income Consistency in 2025. We’d love to invite you to join us on Thursday, December 5th at 9am. Please reply to this email if you plan to attend.
