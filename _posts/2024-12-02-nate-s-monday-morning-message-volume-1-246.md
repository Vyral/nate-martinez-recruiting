**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,246**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! How was your weekend? I hope you are enjoying the beginning of the holiday merriment! I know there is a lot that happens during this time of year, so I want to remind you about the importance of self-care – and setting healthy boundaries. While I love all the traditions, the food, the parties – it however, can get overwhelming. It’s okay to say no and it’s okay to skip one party if it means you’ll experience less stress over the next few weeks. The holidays are meant to be enjoyed and filled with fun – make sure you are taking care of yourself first so you can enjoy those moments fully present and engaged. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

A Mysterious Gift

My husband has had dementia for almost a decade. He has almost no short-term memory. He can no longer read, use a phone, or use a credit card. Six years ago when the Christmas catalogs came, I saw a tablecloth I wanted, but it was sold out. On Christmas morning, there was an unwrapped box under the tree. Somehow my husband had found the right catalog, the right tablecloth, called them, and convinced them to find a tablecloth to send in time for Christmas. I won’t ever know how he did it, but it was the best gift ever. *—Roberta Sampere, Dolgeville, New York*
