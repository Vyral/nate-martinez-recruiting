**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,247**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! How is your holiday season treating you? We are halfway through with only one more weekend for shopping and preparation! I am particularly excited for this year, with a house full of grandbabies to spoil – which was not something I thought about when I was raising my family but what a special and surprising gift grandbabies are – I just want to thank my children for blessing our family with a new generation of Martinez’s that we get to celebrate with this season. What blessings are you grateful for this year? No matter how big or small, there are millions of miracles that surround us every day – I hope you notice them more during this time of year. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

A Father’s Blessing

My stepfather, Marlin, bought a dancing Christmas tree in the mid-2000s as a gimmick decoration. Marlin passed away in 2014. My sister, Stacy, had taken possession of it along the way. Stacy got engaged to her longtime boyfriend on Thanksgiving night. Marlin had met him. The tree was unpacked, but had no batteries. Later that evening, with all the ladies sitting around talking, the tree lit up and started to dance! The empty battery pack was in hand and the only conclusion we could reach was that Marlin was sending his blessing and dancing for us. *—Norman Powers, Sheffield, Alabama.*
