**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,249**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope you had a lovely holiday celebration, and now we are on the final days of 2024. As we wrap up this year, I hope that you will set aside some time to reflect on the last 12 months and take inventory – even in the midst of chaos or stress, loss or heartbreak, there is always something to be grateful for – and I am grateful for each of you. Thank you for being a part of my story.

Wishing you a very happy New Year – please be safe and stay healthy – cheers to a New Year! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

**Happy New Year Wish**

My Happy New Year wish for you<br>Is for your best year yet,<br>A year where life is peaceful,<br>And what you want, you get.

A year in which you cherish<br>The past year’s memories,<br>And live your life each new day,<br>Full of bright expectancies.

I wish for you a holiday<br>With happiness galore;<br>And when it’s done, I wish you<br>Happy New Year, and many more.
