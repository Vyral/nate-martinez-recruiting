**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,251**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! How was the first week of the New Year? I hope you had a great week! I was listening to a podcast recently that talked about taking inventory on the previous year. So, I made a little time to go through all the photos on my phone that I took starting in January 2024. I didn’t realize that I had traveled to 17 cities for both professional events, as well as hockey games for my daughter Mila. I also enjoyed being reminded of all the time I spent with my family and the celebration of two new grandbabies joining our tribe. It was a great experience revisiting each month and reflecting on what truly makes me happy – time with my family.

I’d encourage you to take a moment this week and do the same – what brought you joy in 2024? What experiences did you have that made you happy? And as you reflect, think about what you want to focus on in 2025. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Soar Like an Eagle

Did you know that an eagle can foresee when a storm is approaching long before it breaks?

Instead of hiding, the eagle will fly to some high point and wait for the winds to come.

When the storm hits, it sets its wings so that the wind can pick it up and lift it above the storm. While the storm rages below, the eagle soars above it.

The eagle does not escape or hide from the storm; instead, it uses the storm to lift it higher. It rises on the stormy winds which others dread.

When the storm of life or challenges hits us, we can rise above them and soar like the eagle that rides the storm’s winds. Don’t be afraid of the storms or the challenges in your life. Use it to lift you higher in your life.
