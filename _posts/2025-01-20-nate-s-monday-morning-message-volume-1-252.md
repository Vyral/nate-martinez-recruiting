**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,252**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope this message finds you well, healthy and ready for a fresh, new week. Today is a day for reflection and gratitude for a great leader of our time – Martin Luther King Jr.

Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a time to honor the legacy of a leader who championed equality, justice, and compassion. His vision for a world united by mutual respect and understanding continues to inspire us to build better communities and workplaces. As we celebrate this day, let us reflect on his message of hope and commitment to positive change in all that we do. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

"I've Been to the Mountaintop"

April 3, 1968

“We’ve got some difficult days ahead,” Martin Luther King, Jr., told an overflowing crowd in Memphis, Tennessee, on 3 April 1968, where the city’s sanitation workers were striking. “But it really doesn’t matter with me now, because I’ve been to the mountaintop … I’ve seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land.” Less than 24 hours after these prophetic words, King was assassinated by James Earl Ray.

In a prophetic finale to his speech, King revealed that he was not afraid to die: “Like anybody, I would like to live a long life—longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will…. And so I’m happy tonight; I’m not worried about anything; I’m not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.” Witnesses, including Abernathy, Andrew Young, and James Jordan said King had tears in his eyes as he took his seat. “This time it just seemed like he was just saying, ‘Goodbye, I hate to leave,’” Jordan supposed. On 4 April, while King waited for a limousine to take him to dinner at Reverend Billy Kyles’ home, he was fatally shot on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel.
