**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,253**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope this email finds you rested, rejuvenated and ready for the final week of the first month of 2025! I am preparing to attend a personal development event with a group of like-minded men in Park City, Utah. Every year we gather for this event, and it is experience that changes me every year. There are no excuses like “the dog ate my homework” with this highly committed group! That got me thinking about how many personal development events I participate in annually – and wondering if you too commit to yourself development. Its said that the most successful people attend a minimum of 6 events per year just to work on their own skills, mindset, relationships, etc. That is pretty powerful! I’d love to hear your favorite go-to events, and they don’t have to be real estate related. Let’s help each other grow and become our best selves! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Once a dog ran into a museum filled with mirrors. The museum was unique; the walls, the ceiling, the doors and even the floors were made of mirrors. Seeing his reflections, the dog froze in surprise in the middle of the hall. He could see a whole pack of dogs surrounding him from all sides, from above and below.

The dog bared his teeth and barked all the reflections responded to it in the same way. Frightened, the dog barked frantically; the dog’s reflections imitated the dog and increased it many times. The dog barked even harder, but the echo was magnified. The dog, tossed from one side to another while his reflections also tossed around snapping their teeth.

The following day, the museum security guards found the miserable, lifeless dog, surrounded by thousands of reflections of the lifeless dog. There was nobody to harm the dog. The dog died by fighting with his own reflections.

**Moral:** The world doesn’t bring good or evil on its own. Everything that is happening around us reflects our thoughts, feelings, wishes and actions. The world is a big mirror. So let’s strike a good pose!
