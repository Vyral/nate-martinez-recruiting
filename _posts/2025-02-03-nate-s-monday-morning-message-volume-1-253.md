Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Can you believe it’s the first week of February?

With the first month of 2025 behind us, it’s the perfect time to reflect on your progress and stay focused on your goals. Are you on track with your goals, or do you need to make some adjustments? January sets the tone for the year—how do you feel about your progress so far? Whether you’re crushing it or facing challenges, now is the time to fine-tune your approach and keep moving forward with intention and purpose. Let’s make 2025 a year of growth and success! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

As I walked through the parking lot, all I could think about was the dire diagnosis I had handed my patient Jimmy: pancreatic cancer. Just then, I noticed an elderly gentleman handing tools to someone working under his stalled car. That someone was Jimmy. “Jimmy, what are you doing?” I yelled out. Jimmy dusted off his pants. “My cancer didn’t tell me not to help others, Doc,” he said, before waving at the old man to start the car. The engine roared to life. The old man thanked Jimmy and drove off. Then Jimmy got into his car and took off as well. Take-home message: Kindness has no limits and no restrictions. –Mohammed Basha, Gainesville, Florida.
