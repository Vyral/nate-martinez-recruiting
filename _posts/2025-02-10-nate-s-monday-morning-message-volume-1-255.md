**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,255**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope this email finds you rested and ready to welcome a new week. Today, I want to talk about obstacles…obstacles, while often frustrating, can be one of life’s greatest teachers. They challenge us to grow, push us beyond our comfort zones, and build resilience in ways that smooth paths never could. Every setback presents an opportunity to learn, adapt, and become stronger, shaping us into more capable and determined individuals. Whether in business, relationships, or personal development, overcoming difficulties fosters creativity, problem-solving skills, and a deeper appreciation for success. Instead of seeing obstacles as roadblocks, embracing them as steppingstones can lead to greater achievements and a more fulfilling life. What obstacles can you embrace this month? Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

While going through a divorce, my mother fretted over her new worries: no income, the same bills, and no way to afford groceries. It was around this time that she started finding boxes of food outside our door every morning. This went on for months until she was able to land a job. We never did find out who left the groceries, but they truly saved our lives. —*Jamie Boleyn, Emmett, Idaho*

“If you find a path with no obstacles, it probably doesn't lead anywhere.” Frank A. Clark

“Obstacles don't have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it.” - Michael Jordan<br>
