**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,256**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Presidents Day is more than just a long weekend—it’s a time to reflect on the leaders who have shaped our nation. From the resilience of George Washington to the bold vision of Abraham Lincoln, each president has played a role in guiding America through pivotal moments in history. Taking a moment to remember their contributions helps us appreciate the sacrifices, leadership, and decisions that have influenced the freedoms we enjoy today. Whether you’re in business, real estate, or any profession, leadership and perseverance are qualities we can all learn from. Please have a safe and healthy holiday! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Breaking Bread

Before work one day last December, I stopped at a deli and ordered an everything bagel with cream cheese. It was toasty warm, and I couldn’t wait to dig in. But as I left the store, I noticed an older indigent gentleman sitting at the bus stop. Knowing it would probably be his only warm meal of the day, I gave him the bagel. But all was not lost for me. Another customer from the deli offered me half of her bagel. I was so delighted because I realized that in one way or another, we are all looked after. —*L. Figueroa, Phoenix, Arizona*
