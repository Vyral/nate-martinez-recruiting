**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,257**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Life is full of challenges, setbacks, and unexpected hardships. How we respond to these moments defines our character and, ultimately, our success. Washington Irving’s quote, *“Little minds are tamed and subdued by misfortune; but great minds rise above them,”* speaks to the power of resilience and perspective in overcoming adversity.

A “little mind” allows hardship to defeat it, becoming overwhelmed and discouraged. These individuals may give up or let failure define them. In contrast, a “great mind” sees misfortune as a test, an opportunity to grow stronger, wiser, and more determined. Instead of being controlled by setbacks, they learn, adapt, and push forward.

Think about history’s most influential figures—leaders, inventors, and visionaries. They all faced adversity, yet their ability to rise above it is what set them apart. Whether in business, personal life, or any pursuit, greatness isn’t about avoiding failure—it’s about refusing to let it keep you down.

So, when misfortune strikes, will you let it tame you, or will you rise above it? The choice is yours. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Highway Hero

Driving home in a blizzard, I noticed a vehicle trailing close behind me. Suddenly, my tire blew! I pulled off the road, and so did the other car. A man jumped out from behind the wheel and without hesitation changed the flat. “I was going to get off two miles back,” he said. “But I didn’t think that tire looked good.” —*Marilyn Attebery, Spokane Valley, Washington*
