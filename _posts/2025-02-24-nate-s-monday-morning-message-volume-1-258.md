**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,258**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I have just returned from the annual RE/MAX Convention in Las Vegas – in the many years of being a RE/MAX agent, I have made it a part of my business plan to attend this event each year. From the beginning of my career, I have always been the guy who sits in the front row and soaks up everything I can from the speaker or presenter. I firmly believe that if we are not learning, we are dying. Knowledge is power – no matter what industry you are in. I am so grateful for the amazing leadership team we have at RE/MAX Headquarters, and their firmly rooted commitment to providing myself, my brokerage and all the agents in the network – here in the USA and across the globe – with the best-of-the-best training, mentorship and vision. This knowledge helps me, help you with your real estate goals. Who’s ready to talk more? Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

21 Apples from Max

When my grandson, Max, told his mother, Andrea, to donate any check she would give him for his 21st birthday, Andrea got an idea. She handed Max’s brother Charlie a video camera. Then she took out 21 $10 bills from the bank and bought 21 apples at the supermarket. When they spotted a homeless man, Andrea told him, “Today is my son Max’s 21st birthday, and he asked me to give a gift to someone to help him celebrate.” She handed the man a $10 bill and an apple. The man smiled into the camera and announced, “Happy birthday, Max!” Soon, they passed out their booty to men and women waiting in line at a soup kitchen. In a unified chorus, they wished Max, “Happy birthday!” At a pizza parlor, Andrea left $50 and told the owners to feed the hungry. “Happy birthday, Max!” they shouted. With one last $10 bill and apple, they stopped at Andrea’s sister’s office. Unable to contain her laughter or her tears, she bellowed into the camera, “Happy birthday, Max!” —*Dr. Donald Stoltz, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania*
