**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,259**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well and that you a ready for a new week. As I mentioned last week, I attended the 52nd annual RE/MAX Convention which was the 34th event I have been to – knowledge is power and so is the opportunity to network with some of the best in the world!

Each year, consumers are surveyed to find out what it is that they look for in a REALTOR® - in the latest data, consumers reported that an agent’s reputation (35%) remains the most important factor when selecting a REALTOR®. Additionally, trustworthiness and honesty (21%) were the second highest factors. I am happy (and proud) to share that RE/MAX was again voted the number one most trusted agents in real estate!

To be someone’s trusted advocate is a privilege and something to be proud of. To those of you reading this that are a part of the RE/MAX brand, congratulations on this continued distinction. To our clients, thank you for making this possible. Here’s to reputation, trustworthiness and honesty! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Richard Branson, who founded the Virgin Group that controls more than 400 companies, told me in an interview, “All you have in business is your reputation – so it’s very important that you keep your word.”

There are many people who were at the top of their game when they made one fatal mistake – due to poor judgment, arrogance or the inability to do the right thing. Reputations are destroyed, and all the money in the world can’t buy them back.

As Warren Buffett said, “It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently.”

Elizabeth Arden, the founder of the cosmetics, skin care and fragrance company, said, “Repetition makes reputation, and reputation makes customers.”

Building a great reputation is like building a company; you need to do it one brick at a time. While you cannot build reputation on what you are going to do, you do build expectations with your customers. And if you don’t meet those expectations, you can’t expect your customers to trust you. Your reputation is always on the line.

That list is a perfect guideline for those who aren’t sure what they need to do. Pay particular attention to the final habit: resilience. You will make mistakes, you will upset some people, and you will be blamed for things that aren’t your fault. But your reputation will take a beating if you react rashly. Take the high road, not the shortcut. That’s the brilliance of resilience.
