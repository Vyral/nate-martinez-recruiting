**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,261**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope you had a wonderful weekend and that you are ready to welcome in the last week of March 2025 – we will never see this week again, so how do you plan to make it count? The warmer temps on their way and soon we will be floating in pools and creating summertime memories! I listened to a book recently called Be Your Future Self Now by Dr. Benjamin Hardy. He told a story of coming home from a long day at work and when he parked in the driveway he was overcome with anxiety and irritation that when he walked in the house, his children were going to overwhelm him with a demand of his attention. He paused, thinking about the future in five-year increments – in five years his children would be in school, in five more year going off to college, and even further into the future he saw their graduations, wedding, grandbabies. He decided to change his attitude and instead of feeling negative and anxious, he would embrace their delight in his return from work – he decided he would be fully present and take in their giggles and silly playfulness and be intentionally, because in five years, these moments would be gone. How do you plan to make these moments count? Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

“I started a clothing line while on bedrest.” - ** ** Meg Remien, 31, San Francisco, CA

“In 2014 I broke my spine in a skiing accident. Actually, I broke about 10 bones—six of them were in my back. I could not function on my own for several months and relied on my family and husband to do everything for me. Being in that condition was humbling, but it was also very boring. Binge-watching all kinds of shows and movies eventually became monotonous. That’s when I started to design. After my accident, I was in bed for most hours of the day. My pajamas and sleepwear became uncomfortable. I noticed I didn’t like the waistband on one or the fabric of another and I began researching where I could find exactly what I was looking for. Then I realized it didn’t exist. I also started researching eco-friendly fashion. That’s how my clothing company, Raven & Crow, came to be. I never thought this would turn into a business, but every time I explained my concept to someone new they said, ‘That sounds amazing. Let me know when you have some and I’ll buy it.’ So, with a simple design and bamboo fabric that I adored, I had my first pair cut and sewn. The rest is history.”
