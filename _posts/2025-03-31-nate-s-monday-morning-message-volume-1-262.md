**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,262**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope you had a wonderful weekend and that you were able to rest and refresh. Hard to believe it’s the last day of March 2025! A few days ago, I had a deep conversation with a friend who was struggling with imposter syndrome.

Imposter syndrome is that sneaky inner voice that whispers, *"You’re not really that good,"* or *"Any minute now, someone’s going to figure out you don’t belong here."* It’s super common, especially among high achievers. People experiencing it often attribute their success to luck, timing, or fooling others, rather than their own hard work or ability.

My friend identified that he didn’t feel worthy and felt like a fraud in his life and business. We talked about different ideas to help his business, and I was reminded of one of my favorite poems which I have shared before (but sharing again as it warrants reading over and over)…I gave him this advice: you playing small does not help those in your life or in your community. Someone out there needs you. You have an obligation to show up so they can find you. Playing small or behaving inadequately does not serve the world. We all have a gift or a talent that makes the world a better place. Please go share it. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

“Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.” Marianne Williamson, A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of "A Course in Miracles"
