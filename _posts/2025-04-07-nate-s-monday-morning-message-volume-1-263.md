**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,263**

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Welcome Spring – Spring brings a refreshing sense of renewal and energy. As flowers bloom and trees regain their leaves, nature reminds us of growth and possibility. Warmer temperatures and longer days invite us outdoors, lifting moods and encouraging physical activity. It’s a perfect season for fresh starts—whether it’s decluttering your home, planting a garden, or setting new goals. The vibrant colors, gentle breezes, and songs of birds returning all combine to awaken the senses and inspire optimism. Do you have spring plans? I’d love to hear them! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

**Two Apples**

A lovely little girl was holding two apples with both hands. Her mom came in and softly asked her little daughter with a smile: my sweetie, could you give your mom one of your two apples?

The girl looked up at her mom for some seconds, then she suddenly took a quick bite on one apple, and then quickly on the other. The mom felt the smile on her face freeze. She tried hard not to reveal her disappointment.

Then the little girl handed one of her bitten apples to her mom, and said: “Mommy, here you are. This is the sweeter one.”

No matter who you are, how experienced you are, and how knowledgeable you think you are, always delay judgment. Give others the privilege to explain themselves. What you see may not be the reality. Never conclude for others.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.” - Lao Tzu

“Never cut a tree down in the wintertime. Never make a negative decision in the low time. Never make your most important decisions when you are in your worst moods. Wait. Be patient. The storm will pass. The spring will come.” - Robert H. Schuller

“Nature always wears the colors of the spirit.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson<br>
