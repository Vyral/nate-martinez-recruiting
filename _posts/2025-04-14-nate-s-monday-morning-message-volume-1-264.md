**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,264**

Good morning, and welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! There’s a lot of noise out there right now - interest rates, inventory, inflation, stock market, you name it - its noisy! It’s easy to get swept up in uncertainty, especially when the headlines seem louder than our own goals.

But here’s something I’ve learned over the years: *Your mindset is the real market.*

In business, and in life - our results are often a reflection of how we choose to show up. When we focus on what we can control - our attitude, our consistency, our effort - we rise above the noise. We become problem-solvers, not panic-responders.

That means showing up for your community – your family and friends – your clients with clarity and calm, even when things feeling like they are shifting. For my real estate clients, it means trusting the long game - knowing that real estate has always been, and still is, one of the greatest wealth-building tools out there.

Whether you’re buying, selling, investing, or leading a team… you have a choice every morning: Will I let the market shape me, or will I shape my mindset and impact the market?

Let’s go into this week focused, grounded, and ready to grow - no matter what the headlines say.

Here’s to building with purpose - Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

**Choices**

There comes a time in your life, when you must decide,

No help from anyone, on which you've always relied.

Between right and wrong, between black and white,

Between good and bad, to walk away or fight.

To be honest and true. To be open with your heart, or to hide your feelings, play it safe from the start.

To sit back and watch, to listen and learn, or jump into the fire, taking a chance on a burn.

To stay. to move. To not care or always prove.

To be strong, to be weak, to be aggressive, to be meek.

To laugh out loud with all your might, or smile a little just to be polite.

To stay together. To live apart. To think with your mind, or trust your with heart.

To live in the past. To always look back, to look ahead to the future, with ambition you won't lack.

Begun at the front. Or start at the end, believe in your own self, or follow the trend.

To dream. To hope, to quit, to cope. To be a lover, to be a friend to be real, or just pretend.

Choices we make can make or break, to have to decide at all could be our worst fall.

Choices are sometimes deceiving; you can be lured by the sweetest bait.

So make your decision wisely, because to change your mind could be too late.

Life is about choices, for however we decide, we'll have to live with our decision until the day we have died.
