**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,265: Thinking Outside the Box**

Good morning, and welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! In today’s real estate market, success often comes down to creativity, especially in regard to negotiating a deal where everyone walks away happy. We recently closed on a transaction that had multiple homes involved and when we got the appraisal back, it was below the price the buyer had agreed to in our contract. We ended up saving the three transactions because the clients were willing to think outside the box. I learned something new that day – after nearly 40 years of selling real estate! We can’t be afraid to ask and collaborate on ideas that are different and/or unique. The answer will always be no if we never ask – and I think this applies to many aspects of life – not just selling real estate. It’s not about winning *against* someone—it’s about winning *with* them. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

A long time ago there was a boy. He was smart, talented and handsome. However, he was very selfish, and his temper was so difficult that nobody wanted to be friends with him. Often, he got angry and said various hurtful things to people around him.

The boy‘s parents very concerned about his bad temper. They considered what they could do and one day the father had an idea. He called his son and gave him a hammer and a bag of nails. The father said: „Every time you get angry, take a nail and drive into that old fence as hard as you can.”

The fence was very tough, and the hammer was heavy, nevertheless the boy was so furious that during the very first day he had driven 37 nails.

Day after day, week after week, the number of nails gradually decreased. After some time, the boy started to understand that holding his temper is easier than driving nails into the fence.

One day the boy didn’t need the hammer and nails anymore as he learned to hold his temper perfectly. So he came to his father and told about his achievement. “Now every time, when you hold your temper all day long, pull out one nail.”

Much time has passed. At last, the boy could be proud of himself as all the nails were gone. When he came to his father and told about this, he offered to come and take a careful look at the fence. “You did a good job, my son, but pay your attention to the holes that left from the nails. The fence will never be the same. The same happens when you say hurtful things to people, as your words leave scars in their hearts like those holes in the fence. Remember, we need to treat everyone with love and respect, because it doesn’t matter that you say you are sorry, the scars will not disappear.”
