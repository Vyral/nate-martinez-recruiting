**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,266: Using EQ Effectively**

Good morning, and welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Today, let’s talk about Emotional Intelligence — the ability to recognize, understand, and manage emotions — is one of the most powerful tools we have, not just in business, but in life. It helps us navigate tough conversations with grace, listen with empathy, and build deeper, more meaningful connections with the people around us. In real estate, it allows us to truly understand what matters most to our clients — but beyond that, emotional intelligence strengthens every relationship we value, from family and friends to coworkers and community.

I’ve learned over the years — especially as a husband, a father, and a grandfather — that the way we show up emotionally matters more than we sometimes realize. It’s not just about what we do, but *how* we do it — and how we make others feel in the process. That awareness is what helps us lead with kindness, clarity, and purpose — both in business and at home. Wishing you a week full of connection and intention – let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

“We all need to be needed” Story

Lonely tree was growing among hot sands of dead desert. Prickly sands covered the Wood. The Sun mercilessly burned its bark. But the Tree kept on living in spite of all.<br>One day a Hawk flew over the desert. The Hawk saw the Tree and sat on its branch. He looked around the desert and said: “You are a strange Tree, why do you keep on living among these dead hot sands? Who needs it?”

“You,” the Tree answered.

“Me?” the Hawk was surprised. “I don‘t need you.”

“But if not me,” the Tree told, “You would have to sit on the hot sand instead of my branches. If not me, someone, seeing you sitting on the tree alone, would say that nobody needs you, too, and would ask you what you live for. Sitting on my branches, you, Hawk, think that I need you.

The Hawk thought about it and had to agree with the Tree. If there was no Tree, the Hawk would feel himself alone and useless among this vast desert.
