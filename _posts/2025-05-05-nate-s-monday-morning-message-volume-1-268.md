**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,267: The Valley of a Penny**

Good morning, and welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! The other day I was talking to a friend, and we were discussing money – and my friend shared something with me that has inspired today’s message. She told me that everywhere she goes, she looks for pennies – sometimes she finds a dime and even dollar bills. She puts them in a change jar at home – and throughout the year, she might find several hundred dollars’ worth of pennies. Most of us don’t consider the penny as valuable, and we might just step right over it if we saw it laying on the hot parking lot surface. Over time, finding a penny daily accumulates significant value.

How does this apply to other areas of life? Whether it’s a penny or a healthy meal or one more minute on a walk, over time it makes a lasting impact. Do you pick up pennies? Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Unnecessary Doubt

A boy and a girl were playing together. The boy had a collection of beautiful marbles. The girl had some candies with her. The boy offered to give the girl all his marbles in exchange for all her candies. The girl agreed. The boy gave all the marbles to the girl but secretly kept the biggest and the most beautiful marble for himself. The girl gave him all her candies as she had promised. That night, the girl slept peacefully. But the boy couldn’t sleep as he kept wondering if the girl had hidden some more tasty candies from him the way he had hidden his best marble.

**Moral:** If you don’t give your hundred percent in a relationship, you’ll always keep doubting if the other person has given their hundred percent.
