**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,268: Are you a sheep or a wolf?**

Good morning, and welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I recently came across a short video on Facebook with the caption, *“Are you a sheep or a wolf?”* — and it really stuck with me. There’s a big difference between the mindset of a sheep and a wolf.

A sheep just wants something to eat — it waits to be fed, protected, and cared for. But a wolf? A wolf is hungry. A wolf goes after what it wants, relentlessly and resourcefully. While the sheep depends on others, the wolf figures it out, no matter what it takes.

Here’s the key takeaway: **struggle builds character.** When we remove the struggle, we also remove the opportunity for growth. So as you head into this week, ask yourself — *are you approaching your goals like a sheep… or a wolf?*

Remember, the world doesn’t reward the one who waits — it rewards the one who hunts. Be the wolf this week. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

“Happiness is a choice” story

An old man lived in the village. He was one of the most unfortunate people in the world. The whole village was tired of him, he was always gloomy, constantly complained and always was in a bad mood. The longer he lived, the more bile was becoming and the more poisonous were his words. People avoided him, because his misfortune became contagious. It was even unnaturally and insulting to be happy next to him. He created the feeling of unhappiness in others.

But one day, when he got eighty years old, an incredible thing happened. Instantly everyone heard the rumor: “The old man is happy today, he doesn’t complain about anything, smiles, and even his face is freshened up.” The whole village gathered together. An old man was asked: “ What happened to you?”

“Nothing special.” - he answered. “Eighty years I’ve been chasing happiness, and it was useless. And then…I decided to live without happiness and just enjoy life…That is why I am happy now!”

“Nothing is so strong as gentleness, nothing so gentle as real strength.” - Saint Francis de Sales

“You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.” - Marcus Aurelius<br>
