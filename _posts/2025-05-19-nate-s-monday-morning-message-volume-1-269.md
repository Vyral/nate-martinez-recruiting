**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

The Lost Perspective

Eliza felt lost in the labyrinth of her everyday. A recent layoff, a strained relationship with her daughter, and a persistent ache in her back made her feel like she was perpetually on the verge of collapsing. The world seemed to be pushing her down, and she struggled to find a single reason to feel grateful.

One morning, while trying to gather the energy to start her day, she noticed a single, vibrant sunflower in her neighbor's garden. The yellow petals, the sturdy stem, and the way the flower seemed to reach for the sun – it struck her as something beautiful and resilient. She had to admit that she hadn't noticed it before, or if she had, it hadn't registered in her mind.

That day, she decided to try something different. Instead of focusing on her troubles, she decided to look for the small blessings around her. She noticed the way the sunlight warmed her face, the comforting aroma of her morning coffee, and the gentle chirping of the birds outside her window.

As she practiced acknowledging these simple joys, a shift began to occur within her. The weight of her troubles seemed to lessen, and a sense of peace began to settle in her heart. She even found herself appreciating the small gestures of kindness that people showed her, even those who were difficult to be around.

Eliza realized that gratitude wasn't just about finding the good in good times; it was about actively choosing to see the good in every moment, even the difficult ones. It was about appreciating the small things, the simple pleasures, and the people who made a difference in her life.

She still faced challenges, but her perspective had changed. She felt more hopeful, more resilient, and more connected to the world around her. The sunflower in her neighbor's garden had become a symbol of her newfound appreciation for the small things, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always something to be grateful for.
