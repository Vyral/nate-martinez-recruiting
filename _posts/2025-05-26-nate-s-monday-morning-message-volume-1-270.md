**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,270: Today we honor those who served**

Good morning, and welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! As we head into Memorial Day, I want to pause and reflect on what this holiday truly means. It's more than a long weekend — it's a moment of deep gratitude for the brave men and women who gave their lives in service to our country.

Their sacrifice is the foundation of the freedoms we enjoy every day — including the freedom to pursue our dreams, build our businesses, and serve the people in our communities. We owe them more than thanks — we owe them our best.

As Ronald Reagan once said, *"Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same."*

This week, let’s carry that spirit of gratitude and responsibility into everything we do. Honor them not just with our words — but with our work, our integrity, and our service to others.

Wishing you a meaningful and reflective Memorial Day, let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

In Flanders Fields, By John McCrae

In Flanders fields the poppies blow

Between the crosses, row on row,

That mark our place; and in the sky

The larks, still bravely singing, fly

Scarce heard amid the guns below.

We are the Dead. Short days ago

We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,

Loved and were loved, and now we lie,

In Flanders fields.

Take up our quarrel with the foe:

To you from failing hands we throw

The torch; be yours to hold it high.

If ye break faith with us who die

We shall not sleep, though poppies grow

In Flanders fields.
