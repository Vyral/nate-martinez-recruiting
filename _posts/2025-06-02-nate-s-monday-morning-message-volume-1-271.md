**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,271: Ode to Summer**

Good morning, and welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Can you believe June is here, and school is out? The pace of life is about to shift just a bit. For many, summer brings more than sunshine — it brings opportunity. Whether that is taking a family vacation, summer BBQs and pool parties, or simply a fresh season to refocus on your goals, June is a launchpad. Let’s lean into the momentum, stay sharp, and make this a summer to remember — both in business and in life. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

June, *by Thomas Wentworth Higginson (1823-1911)*

She needs no teaching,—no defect is hers;<br>She stands in all her beauty ‘mid the trees,<br>‘Neath the tall pines her golden sunshine stirs<br>And shifts and trembles with each passing breeze.

All the long day upon the broad green boughs<br>Lieth the lustre of her lovely life,<br>While too much drugged with rapture to carouse<br>Broods her soft world of insect-being rife.

So without effort or perplexing thought<br>She comes to claim all homage as her own,<br>Clad in the richest garments Nature wrought,<br>Melting the strongest with her magic zone.

O wondrous June! our lives should be like thee,<br>With such calm grace fulfilling destiny.
