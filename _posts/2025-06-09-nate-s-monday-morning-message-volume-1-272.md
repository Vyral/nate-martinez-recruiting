**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,272: You don’t have to see the whole staircase**

Good morning, and welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! As we step into a new week, I want to share a simple but powerful reminder: *You are always one decision away from a totally different life.* Whether it's a choice to try a new strategy, or to approach your day with renewed energy—each decision shapes our future. Life is about persistence and purpose.

This week, I challenge you to *choose action over hesitation*, *connection over comfort*, and *growth over fear*. You don’t have to see the whole staircase—just take the first step with confidence. Stay focused, stay intentional, and keep moving forward. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**&nbsp;

Two men were jailed in the same cell. They were in the same conditions, but one of them was unhappy, and the other one was happy.

“Why are you so sad?” – the happy man asked unhappy man.

“What should I joy for? I am unlucky. Recently I was free and had a rest at the resort, and there, as you know, is more interesting than here,” the unhappy man answered and asked the happy man: “And why are you so satisfied?”

“You see,” the happy man said, “recently I was in another prison, where the conditions are much worse, and there is just a resort for me here, compared to what it was. Many people want to get here, but I am the lucky one.”

Everything is relative and has to be learned in comparison. If you want to be happy, just compare your current position not with what is better, but with what would be worse.

**WORDS OF INSPIRATION**

“Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.” - Dale Carnegie

“Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.” - Viktor E. Frankl

“Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short races one after the other.” - Walter Elliot<br>
