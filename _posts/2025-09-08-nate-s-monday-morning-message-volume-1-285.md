**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,285:** “Leap, and the net will appear.” John Burroughs

Welcome Monday! This quote is a powerful reminder that sometimes the biggest progress comes when we trust ourselves enough to take the leap—even before we see the safety net. Too often we wait for perfect conditions, the “right” timing, or every detail to be figured out before we act. But success rarely works that way. Growth happens when we move forward with courage, knowing that solutions and support reveal themselves once we’re in motion.

Whether it’s making that extra call, trying a new strategy, or stepping into an opportunity that stretches you, don’t let fear of the unknown hold you back. The net—your resourcefulness, your training, your team, your resilience—will be there when you need it.

This week, I challenge you to take one leap you’ve been putting off. Trust yourself. Trust the process. The net will appear. Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

Carrot Cake Kindness

I was having a terrible day, and as a treat to try and salvage my day, I decided to order the most delicious (and expensive) carrot cake from a place like 10 miles from me. I splurged extra and decided to have it delivered, because why not?

So I place my order and I wait. And like 30 min later the delivery girl messages me in the app, saying they’re out of carrot cake, but have 2 other options and asked which I preferred.

I was so bummed, and in desperate need of comfort food, so I replied “nooooo! well honestly, whichever is bigger… it’s been one of those days” and she gave a thumbs up and said she was on the way.

When she arrived I opened the door, and she had BROUGHT BOTH OF THE DESSERTS! I was like omg! And she said “I could kinda tell that you like, really needed this. So I picked one and bought the other. I hope your day gets better!” and then she left!

I sobbed, haha. It was so considerate and was exactly what I needed in that moment. The extra dessert was a bonus, but her kindness helped me so much that day.
