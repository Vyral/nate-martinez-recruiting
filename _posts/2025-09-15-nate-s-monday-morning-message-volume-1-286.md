**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,286:** Celebrating 24 Years of RE/MAX Professionals

Good morning, and welcome to this Monday Morning Message! September marks a very special milestone: **24 years of RE/MAX Professionals**. Since our founding, we’ve been blessed with an incredible journey filled with growth, perseverance, and most importantly, people. Our very first business meeting was held of 9/11, to which my business partner at the time, Frank and I had no idea what was unfolding outside the walls of our meeting room. As our teams and new agents filed into the room, their eyes were filled with tears, the waitresses too. I couldn’t comprehend the scale of what had happened until later that day when I saw the news. It was a day of heartbreak for our nation, one that we will never forget.

​It was a rough start to what was an exciting adventure into opening a brand-new brokerage, but we are here today, strong and resilient because of our **amazing clients, referral partners and the agents who call RE/MAX Professionals their home**.

To our **clients**: thank you for trusting us with one of life’s most important decisions. Buying and selling your homes. Your confidence in us is the foundation of our success.

To our **agents**: thank you for your dedication, professionalism, and commitment to excellence. Each of you plays an essential role in shaping who we are as a company. Together, we’ve built not only a business, but also a culture of service, integrity, and community.

As we celebrate this anniversary, let’s take pride in what we’ve accomplished, and also look forward to the opportunities ahead. The best chapters of RE/MAX Professionals are still being written—and it’s because of all of you. Here’s to 24 years of excellence, and many more to come.

With gratitude! Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

What I Saw In The Parking Lot After Putting My Phone Down

I was sitting in the Costco parking lot, doom-scrolling, when I heard a loud and clear whisper. ‘Hey’. I looked around but no one was near the car and it was definitely a voice.

I didn't know what it was about, but I'm not a believer in coincidences. I decided to take this moment as an opportunity to pause and be in the moment.

I put my phone down. I looked around. I took in the scene. I watched the sunset and smelled the fresh air (first smoke free day in a week!)

These are the little things I noticed …

I saw a couple laughing and dancing down the middle of the road.

I saw three men whirl around in unison as a car vrooooomed passed.

I saw two friends bro-hug each other.

I saw a tween pat his mom kindly and gently on the back as he passed her.

Humanity is beautiful when we choose to see it that way. When we put down our phones for a minute and just… observe. Have a great day.
