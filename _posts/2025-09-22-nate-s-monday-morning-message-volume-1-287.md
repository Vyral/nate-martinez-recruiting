**Nate’s Monday Morning Message Volume 1,287:** “Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can.” – Paul Tournier

Good morning, and welcome to this Monday Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well, rested and looking forward to cooler temps that are on the horizon.

**“Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can.” – Paul Tournier**

Belief is the starting line of every success story. The people who ultimately succeed aren’t always the strongest, the smartest, or the most experienced; they’re the ones who refuse to let doubt win. When you believe in yourself and your ability to overcome obstacles, you create momentum.

This week, let’s remember that mindset is our greatest competitive edge. Carry the thought, *“I can,”* into every conversation, every challenge, and every opportunity. Because the truth is, winners are simply people who chose to believe…and then proved themselves right. Let’s make it a great week!

Let’s make it a great week!

**ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER**

A Dogs Life

Sometimes during a hot, lazy, summer afternoon my mind wanders. The other day I was sitting in my chair and my thoughts went to what it would be like to switch places with my dogs. It seemed like a pretty good deal to me. I would love to be able lay around, eat, and play for 6 hours a day then sleep for the other 18. It would be nice being able to do my business outside on my favorite tree instead of running inside to the bathroom. I would enjoy it if a can of dog food could get me jumping up and down with excitement like it was a gourmet meal. I would take great pleasure in barking at the garbage truck as it rolls up our road so very early in the morning. It would be so much fun just running through the house, fetching a ball, or chewing on a bone. And how I would love being able to always steal the best place on the couch right in front of the fan in the summer and under the blanket in the winter.

Most of all, though, I would enjoy being able to share my love as easily, simply, and unconditionally as my dogs do. Just a look from their big, brown eyes lets me know that I am loved. And when they throw in a smiling face, a happy pant, a wiggling body, and a wagging tail their peace, joy, and contentment become quite contagious. They cover my face with kisses, bring laughter to my lips, and swell my heart with happiness.

Often, we are too rushed, stressed, and concerned with the matters of this world. We are seeking to make a buck, to get ahead, or just to survive. And we forget that the most important thing in life is to just live it: happily, completely, and lovingly. This is what our dogs teach us every single day. May all of your days then be filled with the simple joy and pure peace that our furry friends have. And may you always give your love as freely as they give theirs.
