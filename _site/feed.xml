&lt;p&gt;Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Message…I am going to keep this email short and sweet this week! We are almost through the first quarter of 2019. How are you doing with your goals? Are you working a plan to achieve them? We’ve got to work a little harder than the competition, innovate, create and then level up. But remember to smile and have fun, be caring and compassionate, and make a difference. Let’s make it a great week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just for Today! Written by Sybyl F Partridge in 1916 and printed in “How to Stop Worrying, And Start Living” by Dale Carnegie, 1951&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just for today I will be happy.  This assumes that what Abraham Lincoln said is true, that “most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.” Happiness is from within; it is not a matter of externals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just for today I will try to adjust myself to what is, and not try to adjust everything to my own desires. I will take my family, my business, and my luck as they come and fit myself to them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just for today I will take care of my body. I will exercise it, care for it, nourish it, not abuse nor neglect it, so that it will be a perfect machine for my bidding.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just for today I will try to strengthen my mind. I will learn something useful. I will not be a mental loafer. I will read something that requires effort, thought and concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just for today I will exercise my soul in three ways; I will do somebody a good turn and not get found out. I will do at least two things I don’t want to do as William James suggests, just for exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just for today I will be agreeable. I will look as well as I can, dress as becomingly as possible, talk low, act courteously, be liberal with praise, criticize not at all, nor fault with anything and not try to regulate nor improve anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just for today I will try to live through this day only, not to tackle my whole life problem at once.  I can do things for twelve hours that would appall me if I had to keep them up for a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just for today I will have a program. I will write down what I expect to do every hour.  I may not follow it exactly, but I will have it.  It will eliminate two pests, hurry and indecision.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just for today I will have a quiet half hour all by myself and relax. In this half hour sometimes I will think of God, so as to get a little more perspective into my life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just for today I will be unafraid, especially I will not be afraid to be happy, to enjoy what is beautiful, to love, and to believe that those I love, love me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to develop a mental attitude that will bring us peace and happiness, here is rule # 1: Think and act cheerfully, and you will feel cheerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORDS OF INSPIRATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.” - Tony Robbins&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.” - Zig Ziglar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People with goals succeed because they know where they’re going.” - Earl Nightingale&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us.” - Jim Rohn&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Nate's Monday Morning Message March 11, 2019</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nate’s Monday Morning Message&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/181219-natemondaymessage-v1-6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Message! I trust that each of you reading this had a wonderful weekend, filled with enjoyment and memories made. Today, I want to talk to you about fairness and understanding. Many of us heard as children that “life just is not fair.” I am not sure that I agree, because you see life is what you make of it, and fairness is subjective. We all know people who are deliberate, thoughtful, and fair. We also know people who are non-deliberate, non-thoughtful and not very fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would encourage you to take a look at yourself and ask if you are deliberate, thoughtful, and fair. Regardless of what life has done for you up until today, the future is a clean canvas and you are the painter. Make wise choices and be fair and understanding. Life will bring back to you what you give to others. Let’s make it a great week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TEAMWORK by Katrina Losta &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentrate 10% on lack of communication…And 90% in being PART OF ESTABLISHING IT. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentrate 10% on un-professionalism…And 90% on LEADING BY EXAMPLE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentrate 10% on someone else’s weakness…And 90% on IMPROVING YOUR OWN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentrate 10% on accusations…And 90% on GETTING THE FACTS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentrate 10% on lack of training…And 90% on HOW TO OBTAIN IT. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentrate 10% on complaining…And 90% on COMPLIMENTING. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentrate 10% on flaws in the system…And 90% on BEING PART OF IMPROVING THEM. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentrate 10% on constructive criticism…And 90% on LEARNING FROM IT. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentrate 10% on others…And 90% on YOURSELF. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentrate 10% on fear of making a mistake…And 90% on ACHIEVING SUCCESS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentrate 10% on watching the clock…And 90% on PRODUCTIVITY! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentrate 10% on conflict…And 90% on RESOLUTION. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentrate 10% on what you want to be…And 90% on HOW TO GET THERE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentrate 10% on obstacles…And 90% on PERSEVERANCE AND VICTORY!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORDS OF INSPIRATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think for any relationship to be successful, there needs to be loving communication, appreciation, and understanding.” - Miranda Kerr&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think perfect objectivity is an unrealistic goal; fairness, however, is not.” - Michael Pollan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Beginning today, treat everyone you meet as if they were going to be dead by midnight. Extend to them all the care, kindness and understanding you can muster, and do it with no thought of any reward. Your life will never be the same again.” - Og Mandino&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nate’s Monday Morning Message&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Message! We spend a lot of time thinking about all the things we need to fix or improve in our lives. However, what amount of time do we spend being proud of what we have accomplished so far, or feeling thankful for the blessings we currently have? Let us focus some of our attention on those items this week and every week going forward. True, we must work hard, but we also need to look at how far we’ve come, and smile. Life is a journey of experiences! Let’s make it a great week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Dog Can Walk on Water&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a hunter who came into the possession of a special bird dog. The dog was the only one of its kind, because it can walk on water. One day he invited a friend to go hunting with him so that he could show off his prized possession. After some time, they shot a few ducks, which fell into the river. The man ordered his dog to run and fetch the birds. The dog ran on water to fetch the birds. The man was expecting a compliment about the amazing dog but did not receive it. Being curious, he asked his friend if the friend had noticed anything unusual about the dog. The friend replied, “Yes, I did see something unusual about your dog. Your dog can’t swim!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story: More than 90 percent of the people that we face every day are negative. They choose to look at the hole in the middle rather than the doughnut. Do not expect compliments or encouragement from them. These are the people who cannot pull you out of your present situation. They can only push you down. So be aware of them, spend less time with them, and do not let them steal your dreams away from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORDS OF INSPIRATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Appreciation is a wonderful thing: It makes what is excellent in others belong to us as well.” - Voltaire&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A healthy attitude is contagious but don’t wait to catch it from others. Be a carrier.” - Tom Stoppard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around.” - Willie Nelson&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend.” - Melody Beattie&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nate’s Monday Morning Message&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to this edition of Nate’s Monday Message! Are you prepared for the success that you are about to have? This is one of the biggest things that holds people back from success: the fear of success itself. But did you know that fear has the same physical emotion in the body as extreme excitement? It is all in how we label what we feel. Fear merely stands for: false evidence appearing real. Be prepared for the success you have working towards, and it is more likely to happen. Put yourself in a position to succeed in all aspects of your life daily. Let’s make it a great week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just BE THANKFUL &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be thankful that you don’t already have everything you desire. If you did, what would there be to look forward to? Be thankful when you don’t know something, for it gives you the opportunity to learn new things. Be thankful for the difficult times. Those are the times you grow. Be thankful for your limitations, because they give you opportunities for improvement. Be thankful for your mistakes. They will teach you valuable lessons for the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be thankful when you are tired and weary, because it means you’ve made a difference. It’s easy to be thankful for the good things. A life of rich fulfillment comes to those who are also thankful for the setbacks and bumpy times. Find a way to be thankful for your troubles, and they can become your blessings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORDS OF INSPIRATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do.”- Pele&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you want to conquer fear, don’t sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.” - Dale Carnegie&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning.” - Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” - Franklin D. Roosevelt&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Tracking Your Leads Can Save You Money</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GblW1i6gDBE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today I want to give you my professional advice about how to track your leads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point in my 33-year career, I used to only track where my closings came from. But about two years ago, I was introduced to tracking every lead—how it comes in, the source, and our conversion rate. Let me give you an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do an open house and you get five leads. You add the five leads to the tracker, including their name, address, phone number, and you include the source (the open house, in this case). Additionally, if they give you the information that they’re interested in buying or selling, you’ll want to categorize them in the tracker accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our lead-tracking spreadsheet, we have all that information recorded, &lt;strong&gt;plus, the first contact date with the lead, the next contact date scheduled with them, and also the value of that lead&lt;/strong&gt;—for example, a buyer looking to purchase in the $300,000 price range. From there, we can calculate a $9,000 projected commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at my 2018 tracker, I notice that we had 213 leads come in, 45 of which came in with an income potential of $912,000. My leads had an average of $20,000 in potential income per lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Knowing exactly how much return you get on your leads and their sources is vital.%20https://joinremaxprofessionalsaz.com/how-tracking-your-leads-can-save-you-money.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Knowing exactly how much return you get on your leads and their sources is vital.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By tracking our leads, &lt;strong&gt;I’ve found that we’re able to save money and/or move our money away from something that isn’t giving us the conversion we’re looking for and put it towards something with a higher conversion.&lt;/strong&gt; Last year, we underwent 10 months of parallel tracking for two different high-cost marketing for internet leads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, after tracking Zillow and a pay-per-click service, we found that one of those was producing three times the amount of revenue as the other. &lt;strong&gt;Because we could see that, we stopped paying money for one and then doubled down on the one that was working.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t be afraid to stop investing in something that isn’t working because you’re afraid of losing a possible lead that will come in. Knowing exactly how much return you get on your leads and their sources is vital, no matter if you’re running a team or if you’re working as an individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some other interesting facts our tracker also tells me about our 2018 business:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;11% came from agent and client referrals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;22% was tracked all the way to close&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;26% came from open houses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;9% came from Zillow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4% came from sign calls&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5% came from our sphere of influence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, we know exactly where all our leads are coming from. &lt;strong&gt;I challenge you to start tracking each and every one of your own leads so that you can identify which sources are worth investing in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about lead tracking, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to speak with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to this edition of Nate’s Monday Message…Happy President’s Day! There are many things in life that we have control over, and many things that we do not. But most importantly, we have choices and we get to choose to start each day with the proper mindset. We get to choose our own actions, and what we will do or not do today. You can’t control others, but you can choose how you interact with them. You can’t control the outcome, but you can choose how you react to it. This week, make it a point to focus on your choices, and you will find that you have more control that you realize. Let’s make it a great week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two days in every week about which we should not worry. &lt;br /&gt;Two days which should be kept free from fear and apprehension.&lt;br /&gt;One of these days is yesterday with its mistakes and cares,&lt;br /&gt;Its faults and blunders, Its aches and pains.&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday has passed forever beyond our control.&lt;br /&gt;All the money in the world cannot bring back yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;We cannot undo a single act we performed.&lt;br /&gt;We cannot erase a single word we said. Yesterday is gone.&lt;br /&gt;The other day we should not worry about is tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;With its possible adversities, its burdens, &lt;br /&gt;Its large promise and poor performance.&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow is also beyond our immediate control.&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow’s Sun will rise, either in splendor or behind a mask of clouds, but it will rise.&lt;br /&gt;Until it does, we have no stake in tomorrow, for it is yet unborn.&lt;br /&gt;This just leaves only one day . . . Today.&lt;br /&gt;Any person can fight the battles of just one day.&lt;br /&gt;It is only when you and I add the burdens of those two awful eternity’s - yesterday and tomorrow that we break down.&lt;br /&gt;It is not the experience of today that drives people mad.&lt;br /&gt;It is the remorse or bitterness for something which happened yesterday and the dread of what tomorrow may bring.&lt;br /&gt;Let us therefore live but one day at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORDS OF INSPIRATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” - Winston Churchill&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.” - Bruce Lee&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Every day brings new choices.” - Martha Beck&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today I choose life. Every morning when I wake up, I can choose joy, happiness, negativity, pain… To feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices - today I choose to feel life, not to deny my humanity but embrace it.” - Kevyn Aucoin&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Nate's Monday Morning Message - Happy Valentine's Day</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/nates-monday-morning-message-happy-valentines-day.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to this edition of Nate’s Monday Message…Love is in the air as the day for lovers is just around the corner! Whether you are in a committed relationship, or still search for the “one” Valentine’s Day is a day to celebrate what love truly means. It isn’t about the flowers or the chocolates, but more importantly about an expression of our emotions for those we hold near and dear, beyond a romantic relationship. I hope you will take a moment this week to say “I love you” to those who need to hear. I want to wish each of you reading this email a very happy Valentine’s Day! Let’s make it a great week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Valentine&lt;br /&gt;Poet: Catherine Pulsifer, © 2016 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say this Valentines quote&lt;br /&gt;Is one that I wish I wrote &lt;br /&gt;It tells of love that is so deep&lt;br /&gt;It is one that I will always keep.&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me so much of you&lt;br /&gt;I will read it over when I’m blue.&lt;br /&gt;It was written by John McLeod,&lt;br /&gt;And I would encourage you to read aloud:&lt;br /&gt;“Love much dear friends for love will bring&lt;br /&gt;the healing joy and hope of Spring.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORDS OF INSPIRATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you have only one smile in you give it to the people you love.” - Maya Angelou&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For it was not into my ear you whispered, but into my heart. It was not my lips you kissed, but my soul.” - Judy Garland&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Doubt thou the stars are fire, Doubt that the sun doth move. Doubt truth to be a liar, But never doubt I love.” - William Shakespeare&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing.” - Blaise Pascal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are most alive when we’re in love.” - John Updike&lt;/p&gt;
