        <title>What Buyers &amp; Sellers Should Know About Earnest Money</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lyhnr7eaBpY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What role the earnest money deposit plays in a real estate transaction impacts buyers and sellers in different ways.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a real estate transaction, earnest money is a dollar amount that buyers put down as a deposit to show the seller that they’re sincere. What should buyers and sellers know specifically about this earnest money deposit, though?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a buyer, I recommend an earnest money deposit of at least 1% of your total offer—maybe even 2% if you’re in a multiple offer situation. For example, if your offer is $500,000, your earnest money deposit should be $5,000 (or perhaps $10,000). &lt;strong&gt;Your earnest money deposit is protected by the purchase contract we have here in Arizona&lt;/strong&gt;, and there are many ways you can get it back if the deal falls through as long as you’re bargaining in good faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I recommend an earnest money deposit of at least 1% of your total offer.%20https://joinremaxprofessionalsaz.com/what-buyers-sellers-should-know-about-earnest-money.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I recommend an earnest money deposit of at least 1% of your total offer.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re a seller, you want to get as much earnest money back as possible&lt;/strong&gt; because you’re the one who’s liable in this situation. If your house is off the market for two months and the buyer doesn’t qualify at the last minute, you’ll have to relinquish that money—you won’t be able to reclaim it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if the buyer gets to close of escrow, they’re completely funded, and they meet all other contingencies, but for whatever reason they just decided not to close, then you’d be completely refunded for having your house off the market for that long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about the earnest money deposit, real estate contracts, or the home buying process in general, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Interest Rates Will Affect Your Clients</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sDEcnd5d4Lo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interest rates are predicted to continue rising. Today I want to take a look at what it means for your clients.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to take a minute to talk about a common topic in the real estate industry: interest rate predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, predicts that the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond will go up 5% in the next 24 to 36 months. Typically the spread between the 10-year Treasury bond and a 30-year mortgage is about a 1.75% yield. &lt;strong&gt;The yield as of August 7 for a 30-year mortgage is 4.75% with a spread of 1.77%.&lt;/strong&gt; If the yield goes to 5% then the 30-year mortgage rates rise to 6.75%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these interest rate changes, your clients’ buying power will of course be affected. For example, if they were to buy a home for $290,000 with 5% down, their payment would be $1,437. However, if they wait until the interest rate increases to 6.75%, that same loan would give them a payment of $1,786 per month. This $349 increase in interest paid per month is nearly $4,200 per year and $125,000 over the life of the loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Now is the time to encourage your buyers and sellers to jump into the market before it is too late.%20https://joinremaxprofessionalsaz.com/how-interest-rates-will-affect-your-clients.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Now is the time to encourage your buyers and sellers to jump into the market before it is too late.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we believe that the interest rates are going to increase, now is the time to encourage your buyers and sellers to jump into the market before it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Agents: It's Time to Find out What's Happening in Our Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/scYkAmFsseU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s going on right now in our Phoenix area real estate market? Let’s examine the latest numbers and find out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest numbers for our Phoenix metro real estate market are in, so let’s review them today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of July, there were only 15,754 active listings in our residential market. This constitutes an 11.1% year-over-year decrease. Meanwhile, the number of pending listings also dropped—undergoing a 3.4% decrease from last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monthly median sales prices, though, have risen 9.4% since July of 2017, for a current median sale price of $267,990. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the new construction market, activity is booming.&lt;/strong&gt; Yet with so few homes being built in the $200,000 and under price range, both resale and new construction homes within this bracket are seeing rapid appreciation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market right now is very strong here in our Phoenix area, and it will likely continue to be so. With all of this in mind, you may be wondering what these conditions mean for those looking to buy or sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The market right now is very strong here in our Phoenix area, and it will likely continue to be so.%20https://joinremaxprofessionalsaz.com/agents-its-time-to-find-out-whats-happening-in-our-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The market right now is very strong here in our Phoenix area, and it will likely continue to be so.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For sellers, it’s important to keep a pulse on how seasonal market trends may impact your goals. &lt;strong&gt;Conditions tend to lag slightly as we head into the fourth quarter, so being mindful of this change and strategizing your sale accordingly will be crucial to your success. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a buyer, it’s important to realize that interest rates are set to rise. That said, those thinking of buying should seize the opportunity to buy now while conditions are still favorable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Realtors Must Know About Zillow’s Instant Offer Program</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gvKlD23K2BM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;What does Zillow&amp;rsquo;s new Instant Offer program mean for Realtors? Today I will discuss how this change may impact you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zillow has undergone some changes recently, so today I would like to talk about what is new with the site. If you visit Zillow’s website right now, you’ll probably notice that Realtors have been removed from every listing on the site. Now, instead of the name of an agent, the site is advertising their new Instant Offer program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This program shows what Zillow will pay a homeowner for their property. Before, Zillow gave homeowners the opportunity to reach out to agents directly. Now, they are moving past that. This isn’t to say Zillow may not sell leads back to Realtors, but for now, &lt;strong&gt;the Instant Offer program has taken the place of agents on the site.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how is this affecting today’s Realtors? For one thing, it means that people who advertise heavily through Zillow, myself included, will no longer have the option to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is actually investors who will be most affected by this change. This is because Zillow will be getting the first crack at properties investors may have previously been the first to capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also believe that this change will place Zillow in more direct competition with other platforms like Opendoor and OfferPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Zillow will be getting the first crack at properties investors may have previously been the first to capture.%20https://joinremaxprofessionalsaz.com/what-realtors-must-know-about-zillows-instant-offer-program.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Zillow will be getting the first crack at properties investors may have previously been the first to capture.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important for Realtors to be aware of this change and how it may affect them. Staying informed is a critical aspect of any agent’s career. &lt;strong&gt;If you are concerned about this change, my recommendation is to focus on your past client database.&lt;/strong&gt; Build deeper connections with people you have already formed relationships with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How’s the Phoenix Market Doing Right Now?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/B0KJGngf8P4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phoenix real estate is doing extremely well right now. Here’s what the latest numbers are telling us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest numbers are in and I’m excited to share them with you today. Let’s get right to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March of this year, 9,402 homes closed escrow. In January, we only had 6,000 closed sales, which is still a strong number. &lt;strong&gt;This is one of the strongest first quarters we’ve seen in a while.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market is up 36%, but inventory has dropped almost 12% at the same time. There are currently 21,703 homes active on the MLS today. The average list price is up 8.8% to $381,000 and the average sale price is up 9.5% to $316,400.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the most fascinating things I found was when looking at this year’s numbers compared to the numbers from the past 18 years.&lt;/strong&gt; Back in 2001, the average price in the valley was $175,900. In 2007, the market roared to a peak of $345,900 before crashing and bottoming out in 2009 at $159,080. We’ve made a significant rebound since. Today, the average price is $316,365.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who bought at the peak are close to being back where they were. People who bought 17 years ago have more than doubled their money, as have the people who bought at the bottom of the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=People who bought at the peak are seeing values rise back to where they were before.%20https://joinremaxprofessionalsaz.com/hows-the-phoenix-market-doing-right-now.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“People who bought at the peak are seeing values rise back to where they were before.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an added note, I’ve seen more cranes in the sky in the Phoenix than I have in the last 10 years. &lt;strong&gt;High-rises, hotels, and more are being built all around the Valley, which is great news for our economy and ultimately, our market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope your market is doing well. If you have any questions for me at all about the latest numbers or about the business in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Phoenix Real Estate Market Is Hot</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EdB-SAGINJo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s going on in the Phoenix real estate market? Here&amp;rsquo;s what you need to know.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about the hot, robust real estate market in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month alone, almost &lt;strong&gt;17% of all homes that closed did so above list price.&lt;/strong&gt; When it comes to buyers making offers on houses, you’ve got to make sure that you’re writing your offers very aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only 3% of the upper-end homes actually got any type of seller concessions. When you get below $250,000, that’s still a pretty high percentage of sellers that will offer concessions. In that same price point, homes are selling way above list price as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve experienced multiple offers on almost every home listed above $250,000. In preparing an offer, you want to &lt;strong&gt;come in with a higher earnest money deposit, short inspection time, few contingencies, and don’t ask for concessions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=In this market, you need to come forward with your highest and best offer.%20https://joinremaxprofessionalsaz.com/the-phoenix-real-estate-market-is-hot.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“In this market, you need to come forward with your highest and best offer.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re representing the seller in today’s market, make sure that you’re studying the different buyers and talking to their lenders so that you can select the absolute best buyer possible. Again, in a hot market like today’s, when houses are selling above list price, you need to come forward with your highest and best offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Houses aren’t staying on the market very long. In fact, we have less than three months of inventory available, which is &lt;strong&gt;almost 18% lower than this time last year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. If there is a topic you’d like me to discuss in a future video, send them my way; if I select yours, I’ll send you a $50 gift card to a restaurant of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Level Up Your Real Estate Business</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ukd-NMGTiJE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m joined by Sarah Michelle Bliss, who has been by my side for the last 20 years of my real estate career. She’s a great success coach, author, and real estate trainer. &lt;strong&gt;We’ve put together a great class on Thursday, July 26th from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. that we want to tell you about.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joinrmxprofessionals.com/Registration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“10 Ways to Level Up Your Real Estate Business”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;we will be walking you through a ton of information to help you become more proficient and get the most out of the hours that you are working.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class is around three hours long, but it’s filled with content that will help you be more present at work and have more time off to enjoy life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We can’t wait for you to join us.%20https://joinremaxprofessionalsaz.com/how-to-level-up-your-real-estate-business.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We can’t wait for you to join us.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a bonus for being there, we’re also going to be giving you a copy of our 2018 business plan.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a complete business plan that takes you all the way through the steps it takes to build a successful real estate company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the buzzwords we use in our complete agent development are proactive and intentional. That’s where most agents struggle. They aren’t being consistent and proactive and completing the necessary activities to generate the results you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space is limited so make sure you get signed up soon. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joinrmxprofessionals.com/Registration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can register here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Can You Beat the Competition in This Scorching Hot Market?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2OiY4IqcanI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I have some advice on how you can handle multiple offer situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Phoenix real estate market is absolutely on fire, and December 2017 was one of the busiest months of my career. Now that we’re in January of 2018, &lt;strong&gt;we’re getting multiple offers on just about every property&lt;/strong&gt; that we place on the market. This affects the buyers possibly even more than the sellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=An escalation clause is a technique that may be necessary to get the house you want in this hot market.%20https://joinremaxprofessionalsaz.com/how-can-you-beat-the-competition-in-this-scorching-hot-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“An escalation clause is a technique that may be necessary to get the house you want in this hot market.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a buyer or representing a buyer in today’s marketplace, an &lt;strong&gt;escalation clause&lt;/strong&gt; will help you beat out the current highest offer by offering a certain amount more. Essentially, it is &lt;strong&gt;a clause in the contract that says that the buyer is willing to pay X amount more than the highest offer received by the seller.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, let’s say you’re making an offer on a house priced at $400,000. You can put in an escalation clause that says you’ll outbid any other buyer by, say, $1,000. This might be a technique that is necessary to get the house that you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inventory is still very low in the valley, but the demand is very high, so hopefully an escalation clause will help give you the edge you need to get the home of your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about escalation clauses or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in our market, give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-X0Qdkvx7Kw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may remember, I did a video a couple of months ago on the book “Wealth Can’t Wait” by David Osborn and Paul Morris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around that same time, &lt;strong&gt;I had the pleasure of flying David in to give an hour-long talk on his book and how to build wealth.&lt;/strong&gt; The information he shared was truly valuable and is sure to help you build wealth in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=In his talk, David provides a lot of insight into how to build wealth.%20https://joinremaxprofessionalsaz.com/a-valuable-presentation-on-building-wealth-in-your-life.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“In his talk, David provides a lot of insight into how to build wealth.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time you have an hour of free time, I’d like you to sit down and watch David’s presentation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjvbStIUzx0&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can find the video from that seminar here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What You Need to Know About Radon Gas</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5k7lwWDdV8M?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of months, I’ve heard the word “radon” too many times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting because whenever I talk to other real estate professionals, I ask them how many of the homes they’ve dealt with have had radon in them, and they always say, “None.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some buyers from the East Coast have some knowledge about radon, as do a few homeowners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radon came to my attention when I was representing a buyer during a transaction on a house in Scottsdale. This house had fallen out of escrow because the radon test came back two points higher than the national standard of 4%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If the house has a basement or underground air units, order a radon test.%20https://joinremaxprofessionalsaz.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-radon-gas.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If the house has a basement or underground air units, order a radon test.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radon is an odorless, poisonous gas that can cause lung cancer over long periods of exposure. As I’ve learned more about radon, I’ve found that &lt;strong&gt;the reason most people don’t find it in our area is that hardly anyone looks for it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was always taught that radon tests are necessary in mountainous regions because radon comes from granite in the ground. However, this Scottsdale house was on a flat piece of dirt and ended up having a high radon content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made the offer contingent on the seller getting radon levels down. At first, the seller paid $5,000 to fix the problem. The radon levels did not go down. The seller then spent another $5,000. After all the work they did and money they spent, the radon levels actually went higher, which was no good, and the buyer walked away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to make sure that people are aware that radon is out there. If you are buying a home, ask for a radon test. They only cost $300 to $350. &lt;strong&gt;If the house has a basement or underground air units, then you definitely need to order a radon test.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about radon or buying a home, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;
