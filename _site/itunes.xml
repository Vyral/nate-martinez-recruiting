Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,110

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! This past week I had the great privilege of witnessing a few of our agents receive an award at our local board for their hard work helping families with their real estate needs. One of the core values we live by at RE/MAX Professionals is recognition, because we know the power that a word of congratulations, or a job well done shout out can do for someone’s day, their life, their business – and ultimately how it impacts their family. Recognition feels good. It creates momentum. It inspires. This week, I’d like to ask each of you to take a moment and recognize someone in your life – your child for a good grade at school – your spouse for picking up the groceries – your business partner for their collaboration on a new idea – the cashier at the store for their hard work – “good job” goes a long way in making a difference in our world. Let’s make it a great week!

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,109

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well, rested, and optimistic for the week that is ahead of us. Today, I want to talk about fear. There is a lot going on in our world, both here in the U.S. and around the globe that is scary and uncertain – most of it is outside of our control – yet I believe there are some of people putting their life on hold because of what they hear or read in the news. For me, the word “fear” stands for “false evidence, appearing real.” Now, I share that not to diminish what is happening in our world, because that is very much real, however there are plenty of challenges or perceptions that we make into a much bigger deal than they need to be – which leaves us crippled by false evidence, appearing real. This week, I want to challenge you to turn off the news and tune into your heart’s desires, focus on your family, take a walk with dog – get quiet and breath. What fears are holding you back right now that you need to let go of? I’d love to hear them – shoot me an email, or a text! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

John and his friends used to go mountain climbing once every year. This time they have decided to climb mountains in the Swiss Alps. They reached the famous mountain spot in the Swiss Alps and were surprised to see many people climbing the mountains.

John and his friends started wearing all the mountain climbing gear and started climbing. In no time, they reached the top of the hill. After reaching there, friends decided to camp there.

Then John saw another mountain where only a handful of people were trying to climb it.

He told his friends, “Let us go and climb that mountain also. It will be fun and challenging instead of camping here.”

A friend replied, “No way, I have heard people talking about that mountain. It seems the path is difficult to climb, and only a few people can able to climb.”

People nearby hearing the conversation made fun of John and said, “If it was easy to climb, why we were sitting idle here.” Hearing them, John took that as a challenge and went alone towards climbing the peak.

Two hours later, he reached the top of the hill. People who were already there welcomed John with a round of applause. John was happy having climbed the peak. He could see the beautiful views of nature from the top.

He started a conversation with people and asked them, “While climbing this peak, I felt it was not so difficult. Then why only a handful of people here? If people could climb the below peak, they can climb here also if they put in some effort.”

A veteran climber replied, “Most people in the crowd right there are happy with what they find easy. They never think that they have the potential to achieve more. Even people who are not happy there do not want to take any risk. They think if we take risks, they will lose what they already have. But to reach a new peak, we need to put in our effort. Many of them do not show any courage, and they remain part of the crowd the whole life. And keep complaining about the handful of courageous people and call them lucky.”

Hearing this, John thanked the veteran for explaining the importance of courage in our life.

Moral of the story

In our life, many of us stay in our comfort zone. But to achieve something big, we need effort and courage. We should never stop, have the courage to push ourselves out of the crowd.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,108

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well, rested and that you had a lovely weekend celebrating with family and friends. Today, I want to talk about priorities. Over the years, our priorities change – for example, when my children were young, they were my priority – to provide a beautiful home, a good education – now as they are grown and started their own families, my priority is now my grandchildren. I wasn’t always great at putting my priorities in the right order, which was painful and costly, in many ways. It takes an effort, and it takes acknowledging what your priorities are – how important are they? Are you willing to move mountains for them? Are you willing to sacrifice? Are you willing to do whatever it takes? This week, I’d like to challenge you to reconsider your priorities – and ask yourself if they are in the right order so you can live your best life – and your family can too. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Imagine that you are juggling five balls.

Each of them is representing important parts of our life – family, health, spirit, friends and work.

Four balls are made of glass and only one is made of rubber.

We need to recognize that work is a rubber ball. While family, friends, health and spirit are very fragile, and if you drop one of them, they will be irreversibly damaged or even shattered.

This understanding will help to keep the balance in your life.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,107

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! How did your week go? Did you find an opportunity to embrace the changes in your life? I’d love to hear from you! This week let’s talk about the real estate market and more importantly interest rates. If you are in the industry, you know that rates took a bit of a hike last week – and if you are an active buyer in the market, this might have you concerned about the affordability. When I bought my first house, the interest rate on my loan was 18 percent – we have come a long way!

For years, we have been spoiled and perhaps we have taken for granted the low, low interest rates. There are many factors contributing to the Fed’s decision to raise the rates, and I won’t bore you with the complexities of inflation and how the real estate industry contributes. What I do want to share, is this – we can’t control the interest rates, we can’t control inflation, we can’t control what someone is willing to pay for a home. What we can control is our decision to be a homeowner. The vast benefits of owning your own home (or two or three) far outweigh paying a little more in interest, especially if you plan to occupy the home for 10+ years.

I have been blessed to serve my community for more than 35 years and I have experienced many different markets, including the great crash – if you are thinking we will experience that again, and you are waiting to buy, please reach out to me today. If you are an agent struggling to find your clients homes, let’s connect. If you are a homeowner and would love to sell but you don’t know where you’d go, please give me a call - none of our clients have ever been homeless!

Our decisions are the only thing we can control. Remember that. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Just One – Unknown

One song can spark a moment,One flower can wake the dreamOne tree can start a forest,One bird can herald spring.One smile begins a friendship,One handclasp lifts a soul.One star can guide a ship at sea,One word can frame the goalOne vote can change a nation,​​One sunbeam lights a roomOne candle wipes out darkness,One laugh will conquer gloom.One step must start each journey.One word must start each prayer.One hope will raise our spirits,One touch can show you care.One voice can speak with wisdom,One heart can know what’s true,One life can make a difference,You see, it’s up to you!

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,106

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! Spring has sprung and before we know it, the triple digits will be here in the Valley of the Sun! As the season changes, change is a great topic for today’s message. Most of us don’t enjoy change, however, there are very few things in life that are a guarantee and change happens to be one of them. While some changes can be painful and uncomfortable, there is also something beautiful and unique with every change we experience – we can gracefully accept that change is inevitable, or we can create resistance which leads to more pain and discomfort. How do you handle change? I’d love to hear from you! This week, I want to challenge you to embrace change and look for the opportunity to grow and become a newer version of yourself. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Sometimes your biggest weakness can become your biggest strength. Take, for example, the story of one 10-year-old boy who decided to study judo despite the fact that he had lost his left arm in a devastating car accident.

The boy began lessons with an old Japanese judo master. The boy was doing well, so he couldn’t understand why, after three months of training the master had taught him only one move.

“Sensei,” the boy finally said, “Shouldn’t I be learning more moves?”

“This is the only move you know, but this is the only move you’ll ever need to know,” the sensei replied.

Not quite understanding, but believing in his teacher, the boy kept training.

Several months later, the sensei took the boy to his first tournament. Surprising himself, the boy easily won his first two matches. The third match proved to be more difficult, but after some time, his opponent became impatient and charged; the boy deftly used his one move to win the match. Still amazed by his success, the boy was now in the finals.

This time, his opponent was bigger, stronger, and more experienced. For a while, the boy appeared to be overmatched. Concerned that the boy might get hurt, the referee called a time-out. He was about to stop the match when the sensei intervened.

“No,” the sensei insisted, “Let him continue.”

Soon after the match resumed, his opponent made a critical mistake: he dropped his guard. Instantly, the boy used his move to pin him. The boy had won the match and the tournament. He was the champion.

On the way home, the boy and sensei reviewed every move in each and every match. Then the boy summoned the courage to ask what was really on his mind.

“Sensei, how did I win the tournament with only one move?”

“You won for two reasons,” the sensei answered. “First, you’ve almost mastered one of the most difficult throws in all of judo. And second, the only known defense for that move is for your opponent to grip your left arm.”

The boy’s biggest weakness had become his biggest strength.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,105

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! It’s the last week of Q1 of 2022 – how are you doing with your goals so far? Are you on track or do you need to make some adjustments? I was going through an old notebook the other day, and I came across some notes I wrote in 2018 on a few goals I wanted to accomplish. As I read through them, I couldn’t help but smile and be reminded of the power of intentionally planning your life. Many of the things I wrote down I had accomplished. This week, I want to encourage you to review your progress so far for 2022 – reflect on what is working and revise what is not. Reset, refocus and let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

There was a man, who lived in the mountain village, and he was known because he has never argued with anyone. One day some correspondent, who wished to write about this man in the Guinness book of records, came to him. They had the following conversation:

“Please tell me, is it true, that you have lived more than 90 years and never argued with anyone?”

“Yes, it is true.”

“Absolutely with no one? Absolutely with no one, at all! Even with your wife?

“Even with my wife.”

“Even with your children?”

“Even with my children.”

“Not once for 90 years?”

“Not once.”

“Not once absolutely with no one?” — becoming angry, the correspondent asked.

“Yes,” —the old man said quietly.

The correspondent (blushing and becoming irritated): “It can‘t be, that you had not argued with anyone for all your life!”

“I had, had, had…” the old man said apologetically.

Four reasons why our market isn’t going to crash anytime soon.

Is our market going to crash? I get this question almost every day, and my answer is a hard no. The demand for real estate in our Phoenix market is unheard of, and besides that, there are four good reasons why our market is still strong:

1. Multiple offers. Even after 16 months of a competitive market, we still see multiple-offer situations, so demand is not letting up.

2. Low inventory. This goes back to supply and demand. We have a very small supply of homes and a huge demand from buyers.

3. Job creation. There are cranes and new manufacturing plants everywhere you look in Phoenix. Another 150,000 homes are supposed to be built in the north Phoenix valley soon. 

4. Price appreciation. Homes increased in value by 32% last year. There is a lot of equity in the market, and it shows no signs of slowing down. 

If you have any questions about the market or just want to chat, give me a call at (602) 942-7000. I’d love to hear from you.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,104

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well, refreshed and ready to accomplish another week. Last week we talked about choosing your words wisely – how did that go for you over the past week? There is so much noise in our world today, and much negativity that it can be a challenge to focus on the good. Today, I’d like to gently remind you that no matter what is happening with the world, no matter how bleak things might seem, there is always something good to see around you. Even as small as a newly budding tree, a beautiful sunrise, the sound of a child’s laughter, or the smell of a freshly brewed cup of coffee – there is always something that you can be grateful for. This week, turn off the news, put down your cell phone and take a moment to breath in life. There is always something good. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

One cowardly person came to a master of martial arts and asked to teach him bravery. The master looked at him and said:

“I will teach you only with one condition: one month you will have to live in a big city and tell every person that you meet on your way that you are a coward. You will have to say it loudly, openly and looking straight into the person’s eyes.”

The person got really sad, because this task seemed very scary to him. For a couple of days he was very sad and thoughtful, but to live with his cowardice was so unbearable that he travelled to the city to accomplish his mission.

At first, when meeting the passers, he quailed, lost his speech and couldn’t contact anyone. But he needed to finish the master’s task, so he began to overcome himself. When he came up to his first passer to talk about his cowardice, it seemed to him that he would die from fear. But his voice sounded louder and more confident with every passing day. Suddenly came a moment, when the man caught himself thinking that he’s not scared anymore, and the further he continued doing the master’s task, the more convinced he was that the fear was abandoning him. That way a month had passed. The person came back to the master, bowed to him and said:

“Thank you, teacher. I finished your task. Now I’m not afraid anymore. But how did you know that this strange task will help me?

“The thing is that cowardice is only a habit. And by doing the things that scare us, we can destroy the stereotypes and come to a conclusion that you came to. And now you know that bravery – is also a habit. And if you want to make bravery a part of yourself- you need to move forward into the fear. Then the fear will go away, and bravery will take its place.”

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,103

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I heard this quote the other day, which has inspired me for today’s message… “the words I speak are the house I live in.” That got me thinking, especially because, as you know, we sell a few houses around here! Our home is so much more than the place we put our head down to sleep at night. It’s our bodies, it’s our families, it’s our health, it’s our dreams, it’s our struggles, but most importantly, its our mindset. What we think, we speak, and what we speak becomes our reality. Choose your words wisely, because the words you speak, are the house you live in. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

In 2015, nine-year-old Marlee Pack was informed that she was suffering from alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare form of soft tissue cancer. Marlee was forced to miss a lot of school due to her treatment, which involved weeks of grueling chemotherapy. When the time came for Marlee to return to class at Meridian Elementary School in Broomfield, Colorado, she felt worried about being the only one with a shaved head. That’s when her friend Cameron McLaughlin decided to shave her head in solidarity with her close pal. 80 students and some teachers from the school followed suit, all shaving their heads in support of Marlee at a school event called “Be Bold, Be Brave, Go Bald”. The event raised more than $25,000 (£19,000] for St Baldrick’s Foundation, a childhood cancer research organization. “I didn’t think that many people would shave their heads, but I feel good about going back to school and not being the only bald one,” Marlee told Today.com.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,102

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! As you read last week, I spent the week in Las Vegas attending the 49th annual RE/MAX convention. It was a jam-packed week of learning, networking and celebrating the milestone of my team’s achievements from 2021 and those we have the privilege to work with at RE/MAX Professionals.

For the first time in real estate history, RE/MAX became the first real estate brand to sell more than two million homes worldwide – wow! What an honor it is to be surrounded by the best-of-the-best in our industry and to be able to provide the level of service we do for our clients so that we can have this type of reach around the globe. I want to thank each of you reading this email for your trust and confidence over the past 35+ years. This gratitude is extended to the agents who call themselves RE/MAX Professionals – we could not have accomplished this greatness without each of you! THANK YOU! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

24 Thoughts Never To Forget…

Your presence is a present to the world.You’re unique and one of a kind.Your life can be what you want it to be.

Take the days just one at a time.Count your blessings, not your troubles.You’ll make it through whatever comes along.Within you are so many answers.Understand, have courage, be strong.

Don’t put limits on yourself.So many dreams are waiting to be realized.Decisions are too important to leave to chance.

Reach for your peak, your goal, your prize.Nothing wastes more energy than worrying.The longer one carries a problem, the heavier it gets.

Don’t take things too seriously.Live a life of serenity, not a life of regrets.Remember that a little love goes a long way…Remember that a lot…goes forever.Remember that friendship is a wise investment.

Life’s treasures are people…together.Realize that it’s never too late.Do ordinary things in an extraordinary way.Have health and hope and happiness.

Take time to wish upon a star.And don’t ever forget…for even a day…How very special you are.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,101

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! This week I will be surrounded by some of the best in the real estate industry, brilliant speakers and teachers, and the agents who will be representing RE/MAX Professionals at the 49th annual RE/MAX convention in Las Vegas, Nevada.

I have been with the RE/MAX family since 1991 and I have not missed one convention, as I have found the opportunities to develop my skills as a REALTOR® as well as the networking opportunities with my fellow RE/MAX agents from around the world, has been invaluable to my career. I have always been the guy sitting in the front row, learning everything I can to be the best that I can. I see it as we have two options: to be learning, or to be dying. Which are you doing this today? Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,And sorry I could not travel bothAnd be one traveler, long I stood

And looked down one as far as I couldTo where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,And having perhaps the better claim,Because it was grassy and wanted wear;Though as for that the passing thereHad worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally layIn leaves no step had trodden black.Oh, I kept the first for another day!

Yet knowing how way leads on to way,I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference.

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I know many of you reading this will be enjoying a long weekend with the day off in honor of Presidents Day – which was originally established in 1885 in recognition of President George Washington. Today, we celebrate all president’s past and present – regardless of party or whether our guy won or not. To be the president of the greatest country in the world, is a responsibility that goes beyond measure – a daily sacrifice that only a person walking in those shoes can begin to comprehend. On this day, I want to say THANK YOU. We are the United States of America, because of every president who has answered the call to represent our great nation. I hope you’ll take a moment to reflect and share your own gratitudes on this day of recognition. Let’s make it a great week!

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,099

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well and that you had a wonderful weekend with family and loved ones. Let’s start this week with a thought about history, and not history in a schoolbook but rather how history impacts your goals in life. When you set your goals or think about your potential, so many of us base it on what we did in the past – which can be a great place to start. However, I’d like to challenge you for a moment with this question: what if you are where you are today, not because what you did in the past, but what you didn’t do? I know that is a heavy question. But it’s a gamechanger. What are you avoiding in your life? What weaknesses are you favoring? What are you afraid of? What didn’t you do that is keeping you from living up to your full potential? Answer these questions and you can change the rules of the game. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

I was balancing caring for a toddler and working a full-time job, all while my Navy husband was on extended duty overseas. One evening, the doorbell rang. It was my neighbor, a retired chief petty officer, holding a breadboard loaded with a freshly cooked chicken and vegetable stew. “I’ve noticed you’re getting a little skinny,” he said. It was the best meal I’d had in months. – Patricia Fordney, Corvallis, Oregon

        <description>

These are the four best reasons to become a real estate investor in 2022.

Real estate can be a fantastic investment vehicle. Many people have used real estate to build their wealth and diversify their portfolios. Here are the four main reasons you should invest in real estate in 2022:

1. Rent has increased by 27% year over year. Think about that. Vacancy has gone down to 3.8% in the same time. That’s the lowest vacancy figure in over 20 years. Just like the resale market, the rental market is extremely hot. If you buy a home to rent out, people will be lining up to become tenants.

2. Interest rates are still low. They’re keeping homes affordable and keeping buyers in the market. When I bought my first investment property, I got an interest rate of 11%. These days, you can still lock in a rate under 4%, but they’re on their way up.

“Many people have used real estate to build their wealth and diversify their portfolios.”

3. Real estate is a great hedge against inflation. In the Phoenix market, we’re expecting about 3% inflation over the next 12 months. Last year, we had a whopping 32% appreciation in home values in the Greater Phoenix Area.

4. We have the highest job creation in the country. Cranes are in the sky, companies are coming in, and a lot of jobs are creating many more renters for you.

If you have questions about investing in real estate or any other matter, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,098

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well, refreshed and ready to greet a new week with a renewed spirit. Some of you reading this might still be digging yourself out of the snow that hit the country last week…or you could be here in Arizona and enjoyed finally being able to wear your favorite sweater! Wherever you are, it’s a new week with new opportunities to be present, focused, compassionate, kind and patient. Opportunities to recommit, refocus, adjust your sites and get after whatever it is your heart desires. Make the moments count…that is where the magic lives. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

On Sunday, September 16th, Nerissa Cannon summited her first Colorado 14er. Nerissa is in a wheelchair and cannot use her legs, but that wasn’t going to stop her. For 7 brutal miles, Nerissa found a path forward, over rocks, through loose dirt and willows, to the summit of Mt. Bierstadt.

Twenty-seven people from different parts of Colorado rallied together, many of whom Nerissa had never met before that day, to help her reach the top. Nerissa recently attended What’s Your Everest, an adaptive climbing event and fundraiser for No Barriers. It proved to be strong motivation to continue on a path of living with purpose, and of course, climbing.

Connor Koch, who completed his own No Barriers pledge to summit all of the 14ers in Colorado, was on hand to join Nerissa’s rope team. He described the sense of community and support as an emotional experience:

“I’m failing to find the right words. I’m grateful and honored. Special recognition goes to Braden Wahr. When the summit ridge became too steep and treacherous for the wheelchair, Braden carried Nerissa on his back, at 14,000 feet, up loose rock, to help her complete the journey to the summit. I’ve never seen anything so powerful.”

For Nerissa, this accomplishment is only the beginning. Her goal is to “roll” across the United States next summer. Starting on the west coast and following Route 66 to Chicago and then on to Boston, she would be the first woman to cross the country in a wheelchair.

“My purpose in the cross-country roll is to show what I can do because of my wheelchair. Without my wheelchair, the majority of my life would not be possible. I want to start changing the conversation from ‘wheelchairs are limiting’ to ‘wheelchairs enable’ and ‘wheelchairs are empowering.’”

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Fearlessness is not only possible, it is the ultimate joy. When you touch nonfear, you are free.” - Thich Nhat Hanh

“The eagle has no fear of adversity. We need to be like the eagle and have a fearless spirit of a conqueror!” - Joyce Meyer

“You will never do anything in this world without courage. It is the greatest quality of the mind next to honor.” - Aristotle

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,097

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I recently had the privilege of listening to a quick presentation by David Horsager, who is the CEO of Trust Edge Leadership Institute and a bestselling author on the topic of leadership. Here is my take-away from his talk…


  Listen
  Appreciate
  Walk up and be present
  Serve selflessly


While these are simple concepts, I believe that strung together they are a powerful guide to living life to its full potential. Listening is a skill that requires patience and commitment but it’s a value tool for truly connecting with the people you care about. Appreciation is a form of love. To be fully present is to be in one with life, and those around you. And to serve selflessly is superhero skill that has the potential to change the world. This week, I’d love to challenge each of you to lean into these four concepts and see how it impacts your week – your work, your relationships, your attitude, your health. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Everyone around the world knows Starbucks. It is one of the most recognizable symbols next to the crucifix, Mcdonalds, and Superman. But it didn’t start that easy, without perseverance the coffee giant would never have existed.

Howard Schultz, the founder of Starbucks went to over 200 banks looking for his original loan. 242!

Not only was he desperately trying to secure a loan, his wife was pregnant with their first child. After a year of rejections, he was able to secure the $400,000 needed from a doctor and two other individual investors.

Today, the brand employs over 383,000 people around the world.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way.” – Napoleon Hill

“One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say.” – Bryant H. McGill

“To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,096

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I read this quote the other day and it has inspired my message today: “The beginning is the most important part of the work.” – Plato. In order to succeed, you must start somewhere. Every thought you have, can lead to an idea which changes the world. But you have to start. Start from where you are, with what you have – and trust that a way will be made if you want it bad enough. The beginning, the start – its where the magic lives. Don’t waste any more time – get started today. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Life’s Little Instructions

Every so often you push your luck.

Never underestimate the power of a kind word or deed.

Never give up on anybody – miracles happen every day.

Become the most positive and enthusiastic person you know.

Learn to listen.

Think big thoughts, but relish small pleasures.

Don’t expect others to listen to your advice or ignore your example.

Opportunity sometimes knocks very softly.

Leave everything a little better than you found it.

Don’t forget: a person’s emotional need is to feel appreciated.

Never waste an opportunity to tell someone you love them.

Treat everyone you meet like you want to be treated.

Make new friends but cherish the old ones.

Don’t use time or words carelessly, neither can be retrieved.

Judge your success by the degree that you’re enjoying peace, health, and love.

Smile a lot: it costs nothing and is beyond price.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience.” – Paulo Coelho

“The secret to happiness is freedom… And the secret to freedom is courage.” – Thucydides

“Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.” - T. S. Eliot

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,095

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! Today, I would like to take this time to remember and honor a great man in our history – Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. I hope you will join me in a moment of remembrance today for his passion for this country, his unwavering hope for change, and his commitment to equality for all men and women. Thank you, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Excerpt taken from the famous I Have a Dream speech, delivered by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on August 28, 1963, at Lincoln Memorial, Washington D.C.

And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

I have a dream today!

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Faith is taking the first step even when you don’t see the whole staircase.” - Martin Luther King, Jr.

“We may have all come on different ships, but we’re in the same boat now.” - Martin Luther King, Jr.

“I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear.” - Martin Luther King, Jr.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,094

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope that each of you are healthy, happy and safe as we enter into another new week in the New Year. Have you thought about your goals and resolutions? Don’t forget to send me a message, I’d love to hear more about your plans for 2022. I am inspired by the story of Thomas Edison and what a great reminder for all of us – no matter how many times you attempt something, if you don’t succeed, it’s not a failure because you learned something from trying. Think about how different our world might look (or not look) if Edison had given up after the first two thousand elements had failed? The lesson from this story is to not give up – you got this! Let’s make it a great week!

PS You invited on Thursday to hear a panel of your peers talk about the important topic: Protect Your Commission. This will be streamed live started at 9am on Thursday, January 13th. Please click here to let us know you will be attending.

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Thomas Edison tried two thousand different materials in search of a filament for the light bulb. When none worked satisfactorily, his assistant complained, “All our work is in vain. We have learned nothing.” 

Edison replied very confidently, “Oh, we have come a long way and we have learned a lot. We know that there are two thousand elements which we cannot use to make a good light bulb.”

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Character is the result of two things: mental attitude and the way we spend our time.” - Elbert Hubbard

“Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.” - Winston Churchill

“Nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude.” - Thomas Jefferson

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,093

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message…welcome to 2022! I trust that the New Year has been good for you so far and that you were able to celebrate with your family and friends. This is the time of year when we set our resolutions but for many, by February those goals have been abandoned for old habits and stuck thinking. Below I am sharing a fresh, unique perspective to set yourself up for a winning year. And I’d love to hear from you! Shoot me an email and let me know what your New Year’s resolutions are. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Pick one word for the year: keep things simple, clear and precise with just one word that is centered around your goals for 2022. Some ideas are, joy, harmony, action, present, rise, intentional. You get the idea.

Make a list of things you are looking forward to: listings out the things you are looking forward to throughout the year will put you in a hopeful state of mind which transcends to a positive outlook in general. These could be a list of new technology coming out, a new movie or TV show, a vacation or anniversary.

Plan a 365-day project: decide on something you can commit to doing every day in 2022. Keep it simple. Some ideas might include not hitting snooze in the morning, reading to your child before bed, journaling your gratitudes, writing a thank you note, posting a photo on social media.

Set just one goal for the year: instead of a New Year’s resolution, this would be a goal that you have the whole year to accomplish. Maybe learn a new language, learn a new hobby or sport, hike the Grand Canyon or complete a marathon.

Make a 2022 bucket list: this could be a list of new foods you want to try, a trip you want to take, a concert you want to see, an activity like jumping out of a plane.

Create a 30-day challenge for each month: this would be twelve, attainable challenges that you can accomplish in 30 days. Write down the specific actions you will need to do to hit the goal.

Decide on what you would like to measure this year: “what gets measured, gets managed.” Measuring or tracking things like how many calories you eat, how many steps you take, how many times you golf or practice your guitar, how many dates you go on with your spouse.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream; not only plan, but also believe.” – Anatole France

“And now we welcome the new year. Full of things that have never been.” - Rainer Maria Rilke

“Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or lose.” – Lyndon B. Johnson

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,092

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message…I hope you had a wonderful holiday weekend! We are on the final stretch of 2021, which means it is time to set our resolutions, goals and plans for 2022. I’d love to hear what you have envisioned for your life, business, family in the New Year so please feel free to shoot me an email, text or a phone call. This is the perfect time of year to elevate our accountability and go after what we are meant to have. We all have potential. We all have gifts and abilities. What does 2022 look like for you? Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Denmark

Residents of Denmark greet the New Year by throwing old plates and glasses against the doors of family and friends to banish bad spirits. They also stand on chairs and jump off of them together at midnight to “leap” into January in hopes of good luck.

Spain

In Spain, it is customary to eat 12 grapes – one at each stroke of the clock at midnight on New Year’s Eve. Each grape represents good luck for one month of the coming year. In bigger cities like Madrid and Barcelona, people gather in main squares to eat their grapes together and pass around bottles of cava.

Brazil

In Brazil, as well as other Central and South America countries like Ecuador, Bolivia, and Venezuela, it is thought to be lucky to wear special underwear on New Year’s Eve. The most popular colors are red, thought to bring love in the New Year, and yellow, thought to bring money.

Greece

An onion is traditionally hung on the front door of homes on New Year’s Even in Greece as a symbol of rebirth in the New Year. On New Year’s Day, parents wake their children by tapping them on the head with the onion.

America

Crowds have been gathering in New York City’s Times Square to watch the ball drop since 1907. And while the first one was just iron and wood, today you can watch a 12-foot, 11,875-pound geodesic sphere covered in 2,688 Waterford Crystal triangles and 32,256 LEDs make its descent, even from the warmth and comfort of your own home.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Let our new year’s resolutions be this: we will be there for one another as fellow members of humanity, in the finest sense of the word.” Goran Persson

“Cheers to a new year and another chance to for us to get it right.” – Oprah Winfrey

“For last year’s words belong to last year’s language and new year’s words await another voice.” T.S. Eliot

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,091

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message…I hope this email finds you well and ready for the holiday that is going to be here in just a few days. It’s been a whirlwind at my house however we are blessed to be surrounded by our beloved family, cherished friends and all the outstanding agents who call themselves RE/MAX Professionals. From my home and family, I want to wish each of you reading this a very warm, happy, healthy and safe celebration, however you chose to celebrate the season. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

“How the Grinch Stole Christmas” by Dr. Suess

…So he paused. And the Grinch put his hand to his ear.And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.It started in low. Then it started to grow.But the sound wasn’t sad! Why, this sound sounded merry!It couldn’t be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!He stared down at Whoville! The Grinch popped his eyes!Then he shook! What he saw was a shocking surprise!Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small,Was singing! Without any presents at all!He HADN’T stopped Christmas from coming! IT CAME!Somehow or other, it came just the same!And the Grinch, with his grinch-feet ice-cold in the snow,Stood puzzling and puzzling: “How could it be so?”“It came without ribbons! It came without tags!““It came without packages, boxes or bags!“And he puzzled three hours, till his puzzler was sore.Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn’t before!“Maybe Christmas,” he thought, “doesn’t come from a store.”“Maybe Christmas…perhaps…means a little bit more!”

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,090

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! Let’s make it a great week! I want to start by saying THANK YOU to the amazing agents at RE/MAX Professionals who rocked the Hometown Christmas Parade in Glendale this weekend. They stepped up to volunteer their time and resources – and it was remarkable! We had a great time with the kiddos and Santa – we could not have done it without the support and help of each person. I am so grateful for them and the community we have the privilege of serving. If you were there on Saturday, I hope you had a great time – what a wonderful way to celebrate the holiday season. As you prepare for this week, I hope you will consider volunteering your time or resources to a worthy cause that makes a difference this holiday season. Many hands, make for light work. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

I saw a dress in a consignment shop that I knew my granddaughter would love. But money was tight, so I asked the store owner if she could hold it for me. “May I buy the dress for you?” asked another customer. “Thank you, but I can’t accept such a gracious gift,” I said. Then she told me why it was so important for her to help me. She’d been homeless for three years, she said, and had it not been for the kindness of strangers, she would not have been able to survive. “I’m no longer homeless, and my situation has improved,” she said. “I promised myself that I would repay the kindness so many had shown me.” She paid for the dress, and the only payment she would accept in return was a heartfelt hug. – Stacy Lee, Columbia, Maryland.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,089

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! There are only three more Mondays before we call 2021 a wrap – how will you spend them? The only resource in our life that is not renewable is time. When we say yes to something, we are saying no to something else; something quite possibly more important. However, there are times when we say yes to something that changes our lives. Every second counts and every second is an opportunity to say yes to a life changing decision. It only takes this one moment to make that choice. How will you choose? Let’s make it a great week!

PS You are invited! Sarah Michelle Bliss and I are hosting a 2-hour event on Wednesday, December 8th – Gaining Clarity in 2022. We will dig deep into:


  How to shift your mindset
  Lead gen like a bada$$
  Gain clarity on your vision
  A step-by-step plan to crush next year


The event starts at 3:00pm at Urban Margarita located off the 101 Loop and 67th Avenue in Glendale. Margaritas and appetizers will be provided!  Click here to RSVP.

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Once an old man and a young man were sitting on the shore of a wild and stormy river.

“Master,” the student asked, “why does the time flow straight, but always ripples, either slowing down to a complete stop, or racing like a cow with a thistle under her tail?”

The teacher looked at the seething water and answered:

“You see there are a few large stones in the river and a lot of small pebbles. Imagine that the river is your life. If you will only rejoice over big occasions – like your wedding that will happen next month, or like a new baby that you will have after one year, or new business that you will start after five years…then you will cross your life in a few jumps, like jumping from one stone to another. Otherwise, if you will move in small paces over the pebbles, taking joy in small things: a sunny day, the beauty of autumn forest, a good conversation, then later looking back at your life you won’t see ten big stones, but lots of your own traces, and each of them you will be able to remember with a happy smile. And you will see that the road that you have crossed is much longer.”

“But teacher, when I love or when I do the work that I like or when I have a talk with friends – the time flies fast. But the time drags so long when I’m hurt, when I’m afraid or when I feel lonely.”

“You see,” the old man answered wistfully, “this is what it should be. When we are unhappy, we don’t live but we only exist, so the time lies still in our wallets. And only for our happiness we pay the ringing coin of time, that we still have left.”

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,088

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope that this email finds you well and that each of you had a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday celebration! The New Year will be here before we know it so today, I’d like to share a few thoughts about resolutions.

Start small. Change can be done slowly and gradually, which creates a compound effect. Break your goals down into smaller steps that can be accomplished throughout the year.

Be kind to yourself. Self-care and self-love are critical if you want to achieve your goals in 2022. If you have a bad day, tomorrow is a new start. Have compassion for your humanness and know that great things are accomplished with the first step, no matter how messy it might be to get to the first step.

I’d love to hear about your goals for 2022 – shoot me a email and let’s support each other! Let’s make it a great week!

PS You are invited! We are hosting a 2-hour business planning workshop on Wednesday, December 8th from 3:00-5:00pm. Margaritas and appetizers will be provided! Click here to RSVP.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,087

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! Well, this is the week…its Thanksgiving! I know we say it every year, but this year feels like it flew by faster than any other. While this week is about the delicious turkey and the flavory stuffing, it’s also about tradition and gratitude. This will be the first year without my beloved mother at the table, so tradition has that much more meaning to me this Thanksgiving. If I have learned anything this last year without my mother, is that family traditions are what make the holiday season. Passing those traditions down to my children and grandchildren is a gift that I don’t take lightly…to honor and remember the woman who started it all. Thank you, mom.

As you gather on Thursday with your family and friends, please take a moment to share a simple word of gratitude for the traditions. From my family and team to yours, let me be the first to say happy Thanksgiving. Let’s make it a great week!

PS You are invited! We are hosting a 2-hour business planning workshop on Wednesday, December 8th from 3:00-5:00pm. Margaritas and appetizers will be provided! Click here to RSVP.

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Thanksgiving Day by Lydia Maria Child

Over the river, and through the wood,To grandfather’s house we go;The horse knows the wayTo carry the sleighThrough the white and drifted snow.

Over the river, and through the wood—Oh, how the wind does blow!It stings the toesAnd bites the noseAs over the ground we go.

Over the river, and through the wood,To have a first-rate play.Hear the bells ring“Ting-a-ling-ding”,Hurrah for Thanksgiving Day!

Over the river, and through the woodTrot fast, my dapple-gray!Spring over the ground,Like a hunting-hound!For this is Thanksgiving Day.

Over the river, and through the wood,And straight through the barn-yard gate.We seem to goExtremely slow,—It is so hard to wait!

Over the river and through the wood—Now grandmother’s cap I spy!Hurrah for the fun!Is the pudding done?Hurrah for the pumpkin-pie!

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Thanksgiving is a time of togetherness and gratitude.” – Nigel Hamilton

“Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings.” - William Arthur Ward

My advice is to tune out the distractions and stay focused on the basics.

Today I’ll discuss focus. In this crazy real estate market, it’s not uncommon to get daily calls from someone trying to recruit you to their company or see TV commercials from iBuyers. There is a lot of noise out there. My advice is to stay focused on the basics.

For example, Tom Brady has been playing the same position for 20 years, yet he’s still excelling because he’s mastered the basics. He understands every player’s role and takes full advantage of it. What are you doing to take advantage of this marketplace? Stay focused and do your basics every single day. At the end of the year, you’ll have an amazing business.

If there’s anything I can help you with regarding goal setting, business planning, or real estate in general, I’d be happy to sit down with you and share some of my 35 years of knowledge. Please reach out to me at natem@remax.net or (602) 430-5226.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,086

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope the weekend gave you time to decompress, recharge and refresh. Are you ready for Monday? Continuing with our theme this month, today’s topic is kindness. You can’t control how people handle their own stress during the holidays, however you can control how you chose to respond. Here are a few tips…

The next time you are faced with a difficult person, instead of assuming the worst about them, try to have some compassion. Perhaps they are suffering from an illness, or they lost a loved one, or maybe they are worried how they will pay for groceries this week. Its more than likely not about you, so don’t take it personal.

Remember to breath. If you are in a heated situation, pause and take a few deep breaths to help you shift the perspective in the moment.

Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

I forgot about the rules on liquids in carry-on luggage, so when I hit security at the airport, I had to give up all my painting supplies. When I returned a week later, an attendant was at the baggage area with my paints. Not only had he kept them for me, but he’d looked up my return date and time in order to meet me. – Marilyn Kinsella, Canmore, Canada.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,085

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope each of you reading this are refreshed and ready for a new week ahead. Keeping with our theme this month, today I want to focus on what really matters during the holiday season – and how we can use simple tips to help us not lose sight of what is important. Let’s face it, the holidays can be hectic – added stress with long lines, overflowing parking lots and making money stretch to cover all the holiday needs. Here are a couple questions to ask yourself in those moments:

How does this affect the big picture? If you are irritated by the long lines in the department store, take a deep breath and remind yourself – it’s a just a line, not the end of the world.

How can you use this moment for something positive? While you are waiting in that long line, use the time to reflect on your life. What do you have to be positive or grateful for that happened today?

How can you turn this stressful moment a pleasant experience? Look around, notice something new or beautiful about your favorite store. Or make a point to connect with a fellow shopper with a kind word.

I hope you will use these suggestions to help you happily navigate the next few weeks with a little less stress! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

When the supermarket clerk tallied up my groceries, I was $12 over what I had on me. I began to remove items from the bags, when another shopper handed me a $20 bill. “Please don’t put yourself out,” I told him. “Let me tell you a story,” he said. “My mother is in the hospital with cancer. I visit her every day and bring her flowers. I went this morning, and she got mad at me for spending my money on more flowers. She demanded that I do something else with that money. So, here, please accept this. It is my mother’s flowers.” – Leslie Wagner, Peel, Arkansas

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,084

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope all your ghouls and goblins had a fun filled holiday weekend and with that the holiday season has officially begun! This month I want to focus our weekly messages on how to successfully navigate the stress that can be brought on by this time of year. Today, let’s start with perfectionism – something all of us struggle with to some degree, me included. However, I’d like to share a different perspective of what “perfect” really means. We set ourselves up for disappointment when we try to control the outcome of every detail throughout the holidays. What if it was just “good enough?” What if the imperfection is exactly what it was meant to be? There is a divine beauty in the imperfections of life and especially the holidays. Before we dive in headfirst to all the hustle and bustle, I’d like to challenge you to let go a little. It doesn’t have to be perfect to be a beautiful experience. Accept the imperfections as the true gift of the season. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

A blind boy sat on the steps of a building with a hat by his feet. He held up a sign which read, “I am blind, please help.”

There were only a few coins in the hat – spare change from folks as they hurried past.

A man was walking by. He took a few coins from his pocket and dropped them into the hat. He then took the sign, turned it around, and wrote some words. Then he put the sign back in the boy’s hand so that everyone who walked by would see the new words.

Soon the hat began to fill up. A lot more people were giving money to the blind boy.

That afternoon, the man who had changed the sign returned to see how things were. The boy recognized his footsteps and asked, “Were you the one who changed my sign this morning? What did you write?”

The man said, “I only wrote the truth. I said what you said but in a different way.”

I wrote, “Today is a beautiful day, but I cannot see it.”

Both signs spoke the truth. But the first sign simply said the boy was blind, while the second sign conveyed to everyone walking by how grateful they should be to see.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,083

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! It’s a spooky week ahead – are you ready for the count down to Halloween? October 31st is the beginning of the holiday season, and the new year which will be here sooner than we are prepared for. Life seems to speed up, while simultaneously providing us an opportunity to be ever-present with our family and friends. It starts with the costumes, the face painting, the candy corns and miniature snicker bars, the smell of cinnamon and spice, the cool air that fills the night. This is the week that reminds us that there is something significant about traditions – and those holiday traditions start this week. Happy Halloween! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Fun Halloween Facts:


  More people are buying costumes for their pets. Americans spent $490 million on costumes for their pets in 2019—more than double what they spent in 2010.
  Skittles are America’s favorite candy. Candy corn is America’s least favorite candy.
  The fear of Halloween is called Samhainophobia.
  Disney’s Hocus Pocus was originally called Halloween House. It is the most commercially successful horror film of all time.
  The Irish brought us jack-o’-lanterns. They used to be carved out of turnips, potatoes and beets.
  One quarter of all the candy sold annually in the U.S. is purchased for Halloween.
  The holiday dates back more than 2,000 years. Trick-or-treating has existed since medieval times.
  Now Halloween is the second largest commercial holiday in the country.

“A grandmother pretends she doesn’t know who you are on Halloween.” - Erma Bombeck

“Some people are born for Halloween, and some are just counting the days until Christmas.” - Stephen Graham Jones

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,082

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! On October 12, 2021, I celebrated a milestone in my career as a real estate agent – 30 years with RE/MAX! I can still remember the day I decided to leave West USA to join RE/MAX like it was yesterday. It was a decision that changed my life and more importantly, changed the lineage of my family and generations to come. Its surreal when I compare where I was 30 years ago, to where I am today – and the opportunities I have to continue to serve my community and those who I am proud to call RE/MAX Professionals.

I am sharing this with you today to remind you that every decision we make, no matter how big or small has a ripple effect. I had no idea 30 years ago that joining the number one brand in real estate would have such a massive impact. This week, I’d like to challenge you to think about your actions, your decisions – and consider the ripple effect. Then fast forward a year or two or 30 years into the future – how has that one decision changed your life? How has it changed your family? How has it changed your community? How has it changed your industry? How has it changed the world? Chose wisely. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Choices

There comes a time in your life, when you must decide,

No help from anyone, on which you’ve always relied.

Between right and wrong, between black and white,

Between good and bad, to walk away or fight.

To be honest and true. to be open with your heart, Or to hide your feelings, play it safe from the start.

To sit back and watch, to listen and learn,Or jump into the fire, taking a chance on a burn.

To stay. to move. to not care, or always prove.

To be strong, to be weak, to be aggressive, to be meek.

To laugh out loud with all your might, or smile a little just to be polite.

To stay together. to live apart. to think with your mind, or trust your with heart.

To live in the past. to always look back, to look ahead to the future, with ambition you won’t lack.

Begun at the front. or start at the end, believe in your own self, or follow the trend.

To dream. to hope, to quit, to cope. To be a lover, to be a friend to be real, or just pretend.

Choices we make can make or break, to have to decide at all could be our worst fall.

Choices are sometimes deceiving, you can be lured by the sweetest bait.

So make your decision wisely, because to change your mind could be too late.

Life is about choices, for however we decide,We’ll have to live with our decision until the day we have died.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,081

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! Some of you reading this might be enjoying a long three-day weekend so I thought I’d take a moment to share the importance that this day signifies – the resilient Indigenous People. Rooted in history books is evidence that the American Indians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians built a vibrant and diverse culture steeped in tradition, language, spirit and knowledge which has been passed down across many generations. As the first inhabitants of America, their contribution to our country is invaluable – and their sacrifice immeasurable. On Indigenous Peoples Day, our Nation recognizes and honors their inherent sovereignty. Please take a moment today to pay your own homage to the Indigenous People who continue to help shape our great country. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

May the sun bring you new energy by day

May the moon softly restore you by night

May the rain wash away your worries

May the breeze blow new strength into your being

May you walk gently through the world and know its beauty all the days of your life

Apache Blessing

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,080

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I trust that this email finds you well and excited to welcome October! I love this time of year – the crispness of the morning air, the smell of delicious spices, cute little trick-or-treaters, the building anticipation of the upcoming holiday season. There is so much to appreciate about October – I’d like to challenge you to slow down this week and take it all in – take a second to smell the aroma of fall – buy the pumpkin spiced latte – dig out your favorite hoodie – take a drive up north to experience the vibrant color of the leaves changing – take time this week to be fully engaged and aware of the beauty that surrounds us. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

A Few Fun Facts About October


  October and January always start on the same day of the week in common years. In leap years, October doesn’t start on the same day of the week as any other month. October and February also always end on the same week day!
  12 October is one of the biggest days in the history of America as it is the same day Columbus arrived in America in 1492
  For any little animal lovers out there, don’t forget that 15 October is World Animal Day each year!
  In October 1888 the first ever National Geographic magazine was released.
  The Statue of Liberty arrived in the United States all the way from France in October 1886.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,079

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope this email finds you rested and ready for the new opportunities that are abound! How did you do with the challenge I proposed in last week’s message? Are you ready to crush Q4?

As we usher in the fall season, that means cooler temps (or the perfect weather if you here in the Valley of the Sun!), football Sundays and holiday preparations – before we know it, we will be ringing in the New Year! Before you dust off the crystal and bust out your favorite bottle of bubbly, remember this is the perfect time to take inventory of your life so far this year – Are you happy? Are you grateful? Are you fulfilled? Are you healthy? Take the time to answer these questions with sincerity and clarity. Then ask yourself – What is 2022 going to look like? Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Leaves by Elsie N. Brady

How silently they tumble downAnd come to rest upon the groundTo lay a carpet, rich and rare,Beneath the trees without a care,Content to sleep, their work well done,Colors gleaming in the sun.

At other times, they wildly flyUntil they nearly reach the sky.Twisting, turning through the airTill all the trees stand stark and bare.Exhausted, drop to earth belowTo wait, like children, for the snow.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,078

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! There are just over 100 days until we say goodbye to 2021 – and that means there are still 100 days to hustle so you can end Q4 with a well-deserved pat on the back! As we prepare to descend into the final days of 2021, I’d like to challenge you to not only review your goals for this year, but to push the limits – what else is possible? Can you stretch a little more outside your comfort zone? What if you double down on your efforts? What could be the result? This week let’s think outside the box. Let’s think bigger. Can you do it? Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

One day a son came to his father for help.

“Dad, I can’t do this anymore,” he said, “Those lessons only exhaust me, and the result doesn’t change. It must be not destined for me to play football and my dream will never come true.”

The father looked at his son with loving eyes and said, “You know son, every person in life has a dream, a goal of his life. They are the ones that make us do what we are doing, because it’s what we should do. We have to fight for what we believe in, what we feel. In other case, you will simply break, once and for all.”

“The easiest way is to quit everything and not go until the end, because the path is difficult and we are not used to inconveniences. We want everything to be easy and at once. But the wishes are fleeting! This is how our dream dies, and the goal becomes unreachable.”

“Gradually, life becomes a routine without depth and meaning. Then one day, we try to forget and start everything from the beginning, we wait for a new day to make our life different. But new obstacles come in our way, and we stop again. We become full of despair and anger for our own helplessness.”

“But you only need to remember one thing: never give up, fight, battle. It doesn’t matter that you have lost one battle and even dozens of battles. Life goes on! Your biggest enemies are hiding in you – laziness, fear, doubt, indecision. Be a warrior of your dream, a knight of your goal and a soldier of your wishes!”

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,077

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well, rested and ready for a new week. On Saturday, all of America paused to reflect a day that rocked our country twenty years ago…it was also the very first day that RE/MAX Professionals opened its doors. As we celebrated a new chapter in our lives, the world was shocked and heartbroken. I want to dedicate today’s message to the nearly 3,000 people who lost their lives on 9/11…may we never forget. To the handful of agents who took the leap of faith with Frank and me, thank you for your trust and confidence as we forged forward into a territory unknown. And lastly, to the 1,000 folks who have been a part of our company over the past 20 years, thank you. We would not be here today if its wasn’t for each and everyone of you. September 11 comes every year and while it was a milestone anniversary this weekend, may we remember every single day that freedom isn’t free…united we stand as the greatest country in the world. Let’s make it a great week!

        <description>

Here’s everything you need to know about our real estate workbook.

As some of you may know, Sarah Michelle Bliss and I recently wrote a book called Your Real Estate Journey to Abundance in 8 Steps. In this book, we wanted to revolutionize the way real estate is sold. There is nothing on the market that resembles what we’ve done with this book, and that’s because it is specifically targeted at real estate agents. 

This book is really a workbook. You can track your progress and what you’re doing with your day, so the book will hold you accountable for doing the work it recommends. Whether it’s following up with clients, closing homes, or even eating right, this book will get you in the right mindset for success. 

Think about it. If you start your day with three things you want to do and three people you want to talk to, it sets you up for a win. You will begin to start acting with intention rather than mindlessly trying to generate leads.

“This book will get you in the right mindset for success.”

If you want to know more, we recommend you check out our book as soon as possible. You can find the book on our website as well as on Amazon. If you have any questions, please reach out to us via phone or email. We are always willing to help.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,076

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well and enjoying the long holiday weekend. Today, I wanted to remind everyone that while the cookouts and cold beers are a great way to spend the holiday, Labor Day was formed as a day to pay tribute to the contributions and achievements of the American workers in the late 1800s.

At the height of the Industrial Revolution in the US, the average American worked 12-hours a day, seven days a week just to barely make ends meet. Children as young as five or six were put to work in mills, factories, and mines for cheap labor. People of all ages, but mostly the very poor or recent immigrants faced dangerously unsafe working conditions, without access to fresh air, sanitary facilities or breaks during their shifts. The rights and protections we have today, did not come without a fight – and there were many American workers who sacrificed their own lives in demand for change.

So, on this Labor Day, I’d like to encourage you and your family to take a moment to pay respect to those hard working, dedicated people who paved the way for the America we know today. Happy Labor Day! Let’s make it a great week!

 

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Labor Day Fun Facts

The first United States Labor Day was celebrated on September 5, 1882, in New York City. It was planned by the Central Labor Union with a parade of about 10,000 workers who took unpaid leave to have a parade.

The worker’s holiday not only marks the end of summer, but it supposedly marks the end of hot dog season too. According to the National Hot Dog &amp; Sausage Council, hot dog season starts on Memorial Day and ends on Labor Day, coinciding with the end of baseball season.

No white after Labor Day? Because Labor Day traditionally marked the end of summer, people weren’t supposed to wear white after the holiday. Back in the day rich folk would stow away their white clothes after summer as a leisure fashion statement. 

 

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Each year, Labor Day gives us an opportunity to recognize the invaluable contributions that working men and women make to our nation, our economy and our collective prosperity. It gives us a chance to show gratitude for workers’ grit, dedication, ingenuity and strength, which define our nation’s character.” - Tom Perez

“Labor Day is a time to recognize and reflect on that work, and for elected officials to recommit to the too-often ignored task of fighting to improve the lives of working families.” - Elissa Slotkin

“As we celebrate Labor Day, we honor the men and women who fought tirelessly for workers’ rights, which are so critical to our strong and successful labor force.” – Elizabeth Esty

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well and rested from the weekend. It’s a new day and a new week! I’d like to thank everyone who donated an item for our live auction – and a big thank you to everyone who came out for the event on Friday. In just one hour, we were able to raise $10,300 for the Month of Miracles! This money stays local and 100% goes to support our beloved Phoenix Children’s Hospital. We are so proud of the fundraising we have done over the past 20 years – and collectively we have donated more than $500,000! We absolutely could not do this without the support of our clients, family, friends and the wonderful agents who are a part of RE/MAX Professionals. We set a goal of $25,000 this year – we still have a bit to go so if you feel inclined to help, we’d love your donation, no matter how big or small. Below is a link where you can donate online. Again, thank you – we appreciate the support and love for the kiddos. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

A few years ago, I was circling the block to find a parking space so I could get a cup of coffee. A woman walking by flagged me down and said she would go in and get me the coffee if I gave her my order. While she was inside, a spot opened up and I was waiting by my car when she exited. I thanked her when she came out and went to hand her money. She said the coffee was on her. She went on to explain that she had metastatic cancer and with the time she had left, she wanted to do as many good deeds as possible. I shared with her that I was a cancer survivor and the two of us ― complete strangers ― shared a hug and some tears. She asked me to pay it forward as often as possible, and ever since that day I make sure to do random acts of kindness for others as often as I can. ―Sara Marsi, Providence, Rhode Island

We wrote a bestselling book to help fellow agents. Here’s what to know.

Today I’m here with a special guest Sarah Michelle Bliss. We’ve been lucky to be friends and work together for the past 25 years, and a couple of years ago she came to me and said we needed to write a book. We’ve been working on it ever since and now we’ve had it published. It’s called “8 Ways to Dominate Any Real Estate Market,” and it became available on August 3.

The book goes over eight steps to help you weather any real estate market. Together, Sarah and I have experienced both the boom and crash of the market and everything in between. Our book encompasses the tried and true basics that, no matter what the market is doing, will help you succeed. Whether you’re a new or seasoned agent, this book is designed to help you. 

What’s in our book is what we’ve tried and learned along the way. Some of these things you may have heard before, but we wrote it to help fellow real estate agents.

“The book goes over eight steps to help you weather any real estate market.”

One thing we wrote about is the Top 50 Program. The top 50 are the people who know, like, and trust you, and if you engage with them enough, they’ll do business with you. More importantly, if they know another agent, these are the people who will do business with you, not them. The book provides a full-blown business plan to engage your top 50 and ensure you’re their top-of-mind person. 

Here in Phoenix, 90,000 licensed Realtors are running around, so most people know someone in the business. One goal is to get a referral from each of those 50 people. Even if you only close half that number, that’s a pretty good year for most agents. Read the book; take action! 

Please join our Facebook group and simply search “8 Ways to Dominate Any Real Estate Market”. You can visit our book’s website here, and it’s also available for purchase on Amazon. Our book made the International Best-Seller List within 24 hours of launch! 

In our next video, we’ll discuss the companion product we created to go along with our book. If you have questions or we can help you in any way, just let us know via phone or email. We would love to help you.

The Hunters Had Rented

Two hunters had rented an airplane to get to the distant forest zone. After couple of weeks the pilot returned to take them back. After looking at their hunting trophies he said “The plane won’t be able to carry more than one buffalo. You will have to leave one of them.”

“But last year the pilot agreed to take on board two buffalos the same size as these,” the hunters protested. The pilot thought about it and said, “Ok. If it worked the last year, it should work this time too.”

The plane tried to take off with two passengers and two buffalos on board, but it was not able to reach the required height. The plane crashed into the nearest hill. After getting out the plane wreck, the hunters looked around. One of them said to another, “Where do you think we are?”

His pal examined the surroundings and answered, “I think we are two miles south from the place that we crashed the last time.”

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,071

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! Today I want to talk about habits – I just started working in a brand-new journal that my long-time friend and business partner, Sarah Michelle Bliss and I designed as a result of writing our first book 8 Ways to Dominate Any Real Estate Market (which will be available tomorrow on Amazon). As I worked through the journal pages, I was reminded of the power of good habits, such as the habit of journaling every day. Good habits set us for success, they help to get clear on our intentions and how we can win the day – consistently.

If you want to take a peek at this brand new, nothing-like-it-on-the-market for REALTORS®, I invite you check out our brand-new journal called Your Real Estate Journal to Abundance: 8 Steps (which will also be available this week on Amazon). 

Remember, as the great Og Mandino said his book, The Greatest Salesman in the World – “In truth, the only difference between those who have failed and those who have succeeded lies in the difference of their habits. Good habits are the key to all success. Bad habits are the unlocked door to failure. Thus, the first law I will obey, which precedeth all others – I will form good habits and become their slave.” Let’s make it a great week!



WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“We first make our habits, and then our habits make us.” – John Dryden

“If you don’t like something, change it. If you can’t change it, change your attitude.” – Maya Angelou

“Sometimes it’s the smallest decisions that can change your life forever.” - Keri Russell

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,070

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! This week, I’d like to share some exciting news with you! Some of you may already know from conversations and social media, that I am about to launch my first published book with my long-time business partner and teammate, Sarah Michelle Bliss. It has been a labor of love over the last few years writing the book and we are so excited to open the chapters of our journey together in real estate with a goal that it will help agents across the globe.

8 Ways to Dominate Any Real Estate Market is our story of where we came from, how we got where we are today and the 8 steps it takes to dominate any market conditions. Sarah and I have weathered through many different markets in the last 25 years working together and the 8 steps are tried-and-true ways to not only survive but thrive! In addition to writing one book, we took the 8 steps further and developed a companion – a 365-day journal which is everything a REALTOR® needs to be tracking in order to have a successful career in real estate. This journal is a GAME-CHANGER, and we can’t wait to get it in the hands of agents in every market!

Both books will be available on Amazon Tuesday, August 3rd – you can get your copy on our website, www.8waystodominateanyrealestatemarket.com. If you are in the local Phoenix market, I’d like to invite you to our in-person book signing on August 13th from 12-4:00pm at our office in Glendale.

Publishing a book is not something I would have told you was on my career bucket list, however, it has pushed me outside of my comfort zone into a world I never even knew I wanted to be a part of. So this week, while I am share this exciting news, I’d also like to encourage you to get our of your comfort zone and think about the possibilities that lie outside the realms of your current reality. Let’s make it a great week!

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,069

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! This week I had the opportunity to hear Wayne Frederick speak at a RE/MAX event – I am blessed to be with an organization that believes in education and provides opportunities like these to learn and level up our game as real estate agents. While I took several pages of notes, there is one part of his presentation I’d like to share today. He talked about the three different types of time in life: play time, pay time and prep time.

The quality and quantity of your play time is directly linked to the quality and quantity of your pay time, and the quality and quantity of your pay time is directly linked to the quality and quantity of your prep time. Many of us get bogged down with the pay time, because of our inconsistency in prep time. But by preparing more appropriately, you can master the process and in turn, gain more confidence. This will lead to more action and consistency so you can actually enjoy your play time. This week, I’d like to challenge you to level up your prep time. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Here are 5 Essential Time Management Techniques:


  Be intentional: keep a to-do list.
  Be prioritized: rank your task by importance.
  Be focused: manage your distractions.
  Be structured: time block your day.
  Be self-aware: track the time spent on task.


WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“If you don’t have time to do it right, when will you have time to do it over?” - John Wooden

“Time is the most valuable thing a man can spend.” - Theophrastus

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,067

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! Its another beautiful week in Arizona and may I start this email off by saying…GO SUNS! What a great few games and it has been so exciting to see them in the NBA finals. Today, let’s be inspired by our hometown team! What does it take to be a champion? To me, it is showing up every day with a winning attitude, a determination not to fail and the belief that anything is possible with enough hard work and focus. I read once that most people leave 75 percent of their potential on the table! 75 percent! This week I’d like to challenge you to think like a champion and ask yourself how much of your own potential are you not using to live your best life. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

One day a farmer found an eagle’s egg and brought it home. He placed the eagle’s egg together with some chicken eggs to be hatched. The little eagle was hatched together with the other chicks. He began his life like the other chicks and the mother hen. He followed the ways of the chicken. He ate, walked, crowed, and moved like all the other chickens. One day an eagle flying nearby saw the little eagle mingling together with the chickens. He flew down to talk to the young eagle. All the chickens ran away because they were terrified of the eagle. The young eagle also tried to run but was stopped by the adult eagle. The adult eagle asked, “What are you doing here with the chickens? You are an eagle just like me. You can fly like me and your home is high up among the cliffs”. The young eagle said, “I am a chicken, and this is where I belong, together with the other chickens. See, I cannot fly!” The adult eagle then grabbed the eagle in his claws, and with all his might proceeded to fly to the nearby cliffs. The adult eagle said, “I am going to teach you how to fly.” The flying lesson began and to his bewilderment, the young eagle discovered that he could fly. Of course, he fell many times before succeeding. He discovered his true self with the help of the adult eagle, and never again went back to the chickens. We are all born EAGLES and are able to soar high into the heavens. We are not CHICKENS that stay on the ground looking for food, just for the day. We have a higher potential within us, and we should realize it. In fact, we should be successful like the adult eagle, so that we can in turn teach other young eagles, who think they are chickens to fly. Someone once said, “The only way to help the poor is not to be poor yourself.”  

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“I hated every minute of training, but I said, don’t quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion.” - Muhammad Ali

“A true champion can adapt to anything.” - Floyd Mayweather, Jr.

“There’s a difference in thinking you are a champion and knowing that you are.” - Matthew McConaughey

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well, hydrated and excited to relish in the long holiday weekend ahead. But before we prepare for the BBQs and firework festivities, I’d like to take a moment to honor and remember our Founding Father’s who made this day possible. Without the brave men who stood up for what was right on July 4, 1776, we would not have the liberties and freedoms we all cherish in our great country. I hope that you’ll take a moment this week to remember our history and share your gratitude for the freedoms we celebrate. Happy Fourth of July! Let’s make it a great week!

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope that each of you reading this had a lovely Father’s Day weekend and you were able to celebrate the special Dads in your life. For me, this day has taken on a new meaning after my son, Nate Jr. became a father last summer and now watching him develop into an amazing dad is an experience I just can’t describe with words. This week, I’d like to encourage you to keep the recognition going – Happy Father’s Day! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Anecdote for Fathers: A Poem by William Wordsworth

I have a boy of five years old;His face is fair and fresh to see;His limbs are cast in beauty’s moldAnd dearly he loves me.

One morn we strolled on our dry walk,Or quiet home all full in view,And held such intermitted talkAs we are wont to do.

My thoughts on former pleasures ran;I thought of Kilve’s delightful shore,Our pleasant home when spring began,A long, long year before.

A day it was when I could bearSome fond regrets to entertain;With so much happiness to spare,I could not feel a pain.

The green earth echoed to the feetOf lambs that bounded through the glade,From shade to sunshine, and as fleetFrom sunshine back to shade.

Birds warbled round me – and each traceOf inward sadness had its charm;Kilve, thought I, was a favoured place,And so is Liswyn farm.

My boy beside me tripped, so slimAnd graceful in his rustic dress!And, as we talked, I questioned him,In very idleness.

‘Now tell me, had you rather be,’I said, and took him by the arm,‘On Kilve’s smooth shore, by the green sea,Or here at Liswyn farm?’

In careless mood he looked at me,While still I held him by the arm,And said, ‘At Kilve I’d rather beThan here at Liswyn farm.’

‘Now, little Edward, say why so:My little Edward, tell me why.’ –‘I cannot tell, I do not know.’ –‘Why, this is strange,’ said I;

‘For, here are woods, hills smooth and warm:There surely must one reason beWhy you would change sweet Liswyn farmFor Kilve by the green sea.’

At this, my boy hung down his head,He blushed with shame, nor made reply;And three times to the child I said,‘Why, Edward, tell me why?’

His head he raised – there was in sight,It caught his eye, he saw it plain –Upon the house-top, glittering bright,A broad and gilded vane.

Then did the boy his tongue unlock,And eased his mind with this reply:‘At Kilve there was no weather-cock;And that’s the reason why.’

O dearest, dearest boy! my heartFor better lore would seldom yearn,Could I but teach the hundredth partOf what from thee I learn.

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! Well, the summer temps are here and boy, things are heating up fast! Summer is a time for making memories with your family and friends, vacations, pool parties and delicious food off the BBQ.

How will you be spending your summer? I’d love to hear from you! Welcome summer and let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

June by John Updike

The sun is richAnd gladly paysIn golden hours,Silver days,

And long green weeksThat never end.School’s out.The time Is ours to spend.

There’s Little League,Hopscotch, the creek,And, after supper,Hide-and-seek.

The live-long lightIs like a dream,and freckles comeLike flies to cream.

        <description>

Here’s a strategy we’ve been using to help our homebuyer clients win.

Over the last 35 years, I’ve negotiated thousands of real estate deals. In the last few months, we’ve had to start using different strategies to help our homebuyer clients succeed in this extremely competitive market. 

One of the most successful strategies has been our use of private financing. We’re using more hard-money loans to get offers accepted. We put down at least 20% to the lender and agree on terms (which can start at a 9.5% interest rate). We were recently working with an investor who was having loan challenges. We were able to use hard money to get the offer accepted and refinanced to a much better rate once the offer was accepted.

“Every single person wins in this situation.”

Here’s how the costs broke down when using the hard-money loan:


  30% down payment from the buyer
  70% down payment from the hard-money lender
  9.5% interest rate
  $900 doc prep
  Normal closing costs
  $1,800 per month


That 9.5% rate is high, but now we’re in the process of refinancing to a lower rate right after closing. Every single person wins in this situation. The buyer, the seller, the lender, and both agents. Why not try hard money if you’re having trouble getting your clients’ offers accepted?

If you have any questions about this process, the market, or the real estate business in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,061

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! Last week I challenged each of you to ask for help in some area of your life – did you do it? What was the outcome? I’d love to hear your experience. This week let’s talk about feedback. As some of you know, I am in the middle of editing my first book with my co-author and longtime friend and colleague, Sarah Michelle Bliss and in the process, we have had to ask for feedback from various sources. Feedback can be tricky, especially when it is something we are unsure of, or maybe something we really love and are afraid people won’t love it the way we do. Feedback is vulnerability at its core. But without feedback, how do we measure our progress? How do we improve? How do we become best in class? This week, I’d like to challenge you to ask for feedback from someone you trust. Challenge yourself to be vulnerable so you can level up your game and live your best life. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

The Elephant Rope

As a man was passing the elephants, he suddenly stopped, confused by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg. No chains, no cages. It was obvious that the elephants could, at anytime, break away from their bonds but for some reason, they did not.

He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away. “Well,” trainer said, “when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.”

The man was amazed. These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they couldn’t, they were stuck right where they were.

Like the elephants, how many of us go through life hanging onto a belief that we cannot do something, simply because we failed at it once before?

Failure is part of learning; we should never give up the struggle in life.

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! Today I want to talk about teamwork. When I decided to start a real estate team many years ago, it was so we could help more people buy or sell a home and be the number one team in the Valley of the Sun. Little did I realize the impact that decision would have on my life and those who joined my team. In the beginning of my career, I thought I could do it all but realized over the years that with the help of others, the sky was the limit. I just had to ask and amazingly people who cared about me, who saw my passion and vision showed up to answer the call. This week I’d like to challenge you to think about where in your life that you could ask for help – and how does that support change your life and your goals? If you are the person who “does it all” for everyone in your life – I’d like to challenge you to get uncomfortable for a moment. The folks in your life want to give back and by always being the one to do it all, you are robbing them of the joy that they would experience if they had a chance to do something for you.  If you need or want help, ask – I promise someone will show up and if they don’t, call me and I’ll be there. Let’s make it a great week!

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,059

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message! I hope that this email finds you well and having spent a lovely weekend celebrating the special moms and moms-to-be in your life. I know I am a day late, however I would like to dedicate this week’s message to Tonya, my daughter Brandi, my daughter-in-law Ashley, and of course my beloved mother who is no longer with us.

To be a mother is so much more than giving birth; it is an endless responsibility with countless hours of nurturing and worrying. Every day I get to witness my amazing daughter Brandi do an outstanding job of raising my granddaughter – solo – and Hayden is becoming a beautiful young lady right before our eyes! Every day I get to experience Tonya’s patience and steadiness, as we raise our fiercely determined daughter, Mila. She is the perfect blend of both T and I and it is so incredible to watch her develop into the spirit that she is becoming.

Last summer we were gifted with the first grandson and the next to carry the Martinez name into the future – little Nate Martinez, III. Ashley is a wonderful, caring and loving mother to both her sons and Tyler is the bonus grandson we never expected to have in our lives! And of course, to my own mother who is no longer with us – it all started with her and I am beyond grateful for this life I get to live because of her. To each of you reading this and the moms in your life – don’t let the celebration just be one day of the year; let’s celebrate them every day. Happy Mother’s Day! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

I can’t repay the lessonsThat you taught when I was small,Or give you gift for gift,The daily treasures I recall;I can’t return encouragementOr loving words of praiseIn quite the way you did for meThrough all my childhood days.But there’s one gift that I can give:It’s all the love you’ve earned -For love is what you always taught,And love is what I learned.

        <description>

Lumber prices are increasing, and this trend will only continue.

New home prices are skyrocketing due to an increase in lumber costs. Compared to this time last year, the cost of a lumber package for an average-size house has increased by $35,000, and this cost will continue to rise. Gas prices are also going up, along with the cost of labor. Basically, everything is going up—that’s called inflation, my friends. The good news, however, is that interest rates are still in the low 3s. 

If you have a client working with Fulton Homes, you may know that they recently sent out a letter to all of their homebuyers saying that they would return 100% of their earnest money if they could cancel their contract within a week due to construction delays. When I heard this, my first thought was that they wanted people to cancel their contracts because they knew they could sell those homes now for $40,000 to $60,000 more than they did a couple of months ago. I believe that with every new home that’s been sold in the past three to six months, builders are probably losing money on it due to the increase in lumber costs. 

If you have questions about this topic or there’s anything I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to be your mentor, and I hope you have a great day.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,058

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message…today I would like to invite you to join me on Thursday for a very special virtual event that we are hosting at RE/MAX Professionals with global keynote speaker, Nick Santonastasso. He is a medical miracle and inspiration! Nick was born with a rare genetic condition, Hanhart Syndrome. Despite missing both his legs and one arm since birth, Nick went on to become an inspirational keynote speaker, internationally known bodybuilder and ﬁtness model.

Through his remarkable personal story, Nick shares how to realign your focus on what you have and what you can control instead of what you’re lacking. You can create a new empowering story where you’re the hero instead of the victim and, as a result, have better relationships, improve your finances, and become a better leader.

Nick has delivered his message to millions of people, and I am inviting you to join us to hear his empowering message this Thursday at 9am PST online. You can join us live streaming on Facebook or YouTube.

Join Us On Facebook: https://rem.ax/3gTn8zh

I hope to see you online! Let’s make it a great week!

Everyone around the world knows Starbucks. It is one of the most recognizable symbols next to Mcdonalds and Superman. But it didn’t start that easy, without perseverance the coffee giant would never have existed.

Howard Schultz, the founder of Starbucks went to over 200 banks looking for his original loan. 242!

Not only was he desperately trying to secure a loan, his wife was pregnant with their first child. After a year of rejections, he was able to secure the $400,000 needed from a doctor and two other individual investors.

Today, the brand employs over 137,000 people around the world.

Starbucks Stats (via Business Insider):

16,850 Starbucks locations in 40 countries

As of 2010, Starbucks employed 137,000 people — twice the population of Greenland

Starbucks adds two new stores on a daily basis since 1987

And did I mention that Howard Schultz is worth nearly 3 billion dollars?

Perseverance Lesson: Never give up, no matter how hard it might seem. If Howard had not persevered the world wouldn’t know one of the most iconic brands ever.

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Morning Message…happy Monday! I hope that you had a wonderful weekend. Its going to be a beautiful week in the Valley of the Sun and I for one am looking forward to the normal spring temperatures! Today, I want to talk about kindness. Its easy to see the negative in world but it is just as easy to spot the kindness and more importantly be the one handing it out. Kindness might be the easiest thing we can do as human beings – it literally takes a few seconds to make someone’s day and even better, it’s free! This week I’d like to challenge you to practice a little more kindness than normal – or reach out to someone who could use it. Let’s change the world together and make it a great week!

Seven Miles For Me

Leaving a store, I returned to my car only to find that I’d locked my keys and cell phone inside. A teenager riding his bike saw me kick a tire and say a few choice words. “What’s wrong?” he asked. I explained my situation. “But even if I could call my wife,” I said, “she can’t bring me her car key, since this is our only car.” He handed me his cell phone. “Call your wife and tell her I’m coming to get her key.” “That’s seven miles round trip.” “Don’t worry about it.” An hour later, he returned with the key. I offered him some money, but he refused. “Let’s just say I needed the exercise,” he said. Then, like a cowboy in the movies, he rode off into the sunset. —C. W. Stephens, Nicholasville, Kentucky

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in thinking creates profoundness. Kindness in giving creates love.” - Lao Tzu

“You cannot do a kindness too soon, for you never know how soon it will be too late.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson

“Wherever there is a human being, there is an opportunity for a kindness.” - Lucius Annaeus Seneca

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope you had a relaxing and rewarding holiday weekend and that you are ready to face this new week with a refreshed and renewed spirit. Tonya and I enjoyed a wonderful afternoon with our children and grandchildren, which is my inspiration for today’s message – family. Whether it is blended, extended, by blood or adopted, family is the root to everything in life. It is our motivation to get out of bed each morning, the drive behind our goals and aspirations, the reason we smile when we think of days gone by. However, family can also be the first to get neglected because we take for granted that they will always be family. This year was the first year without my beloved mother on one of her favorite holidays. Even though she was 93, and lived a happy long life, it feels like it wasn’t long enough, especially as we navigate life without her on holidays that we would have spent together. This week, I want to challenge you to call your parents, hug your babies just a little longer and offer that “I am sorry” conversation with whoever needs to hear it. Life is precious. Let’s make every second count – and make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

A man walked into a small Irish pub and ordered three beers. Bartender was surprised, but he served that man three beers. One hour later the man ordered three beers again. The very next day that man ordered three beers again and drank quietly at a table. This repeated several times and shortly after the people of the town were whispering about the man, who was ordering three beers at once.

A couple of weeks later, the bartender decided to clear this out and inquired: “I do not want to pry, but could you explain, why do you order three beers all the time?” The man replied: “It seems strange, isn‘t it? You see, my two brothers live abroad at the moment, one – in France and another – in Italy. We have made an agreement, that every time we go to pub each of us will order extra two beers and it will help keeping up the family bond.”

Soon all the town have heard about the man‘s answer and liked it a lot. The man became a local celebrity. Residents of the town were telling this story to newcomers or tourists and even invited them to that pub to look at Three Beer Man.

However, one day the man came to pub and ordered only two beers, not three as usual. The bartender served him with bad feeling. All that evening the man ordered and drank only two beers. The very next day all the town was talking about these news, some people pray for the soul of one of the brothers, others quietly grieve.

When the man came to pub the next time and ordered two beers again, the bartender asked him: “I would like to offer condolences to you, due to the death of your dear brother.” The man considered this for a moment and then replied: “Oh, you are probably surprised that I order only two beers now? Well, my two brothers are alive and well. It‘s just because of my decision. I promised myself to give up drinking.”

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“In every conceivable manner, the family is link to our past, bridge to our future.” - Alex Haley

“The family is one of nature’s masterpieces.” - George Santayana

“The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other’s life.” - Richard Bach

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,052

Welcome to the first day of spring, and this edition of the Monday Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well and refreshed for a new week. It is officially spring and that means the desert is alive with vibrant colors; it truly is an amazing time of year to be in Arizona!

Spring is significant as it symbolizes new beginnings – fresh buds begin to bloom, animals awaken, and the earth seems to come to life again with the return of the sun. This is a new week – and just like spring, there are new beginnings for each of us. Let’s make it count and make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Lines Written in Early Spring, By William Wordworth

I heard a thousand blended notes,While in a grove I sate reclined,In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughtsBring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature linkThe human soul that through me ran;And much it grieved my heart to thinkWhat man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;And ’tis my faith that every flowerEnjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,Their thoughts I cannot measure:—But the least motion which they madeIt seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,To catch the breezy air;And I must think, do all I can,That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,If such be Nature’s holy plan,Have I not reason to lamentWhat man has made of man?

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“No winter lasts forever; no spring skips its turn.” - Hal Borland

“We cannot stop the winter or the summer from coming. We cannot stop the spring or the fall or make them other than they are. They are gifts from the universe that we cannot refuse. But we can choose what we will contribute to life when each arrives.” - Gary Zukav

“The beautiful spring came; and when Nature resumes her loveliness, the human soul is apt to revive also.” - Harriet Ann Jacobs

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,051

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! In honor of St. Patrick’s Day, I thought I would write about luck in today’s message. Do you believe in luck? Have you experienced luck? Is there such a thing as luck in the rea world?

By definition, luck is success or failure brought on by chance rather than your action. Sounds almost mystical! However, I believe that to be “lucky” we have to have vision, determination, and hustle. Or in other words, you have to make your own luck in order to be “lucky.” I’d like to challenge you to channel your inner-Leprechaun and create a week full of grit and hustle that leads to wins and victories that others might call luck! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Fun St. Patrick’s Day Fact: Leprechauns Are Likely Based on Celtic Fairies

The red-haired, green-clothed Leprechaun is commonly associated with St. Patrick’s Day. The original Irish name for these figures of folklore is “lobaircin,” meaning “small-bodied fellow.” Belief in leprechauns likely stems from Celtic belief in fairies— tiny men and women who could use their magical powers to serve good or evil. In Celtic folktales

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Luck is believing you’re lucky.” – Tennessee Williams

“May the road rise up to meet you. May the wind be always at your back.” - Irish Blessing

“You gotta try your luck at least once a day, because you could be going around lucky all day and not even know it.” – Jimmy Dean

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,050

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Recently I was listening to an interview with Matthew McConaughey as he was talking about his recently published book, Greenlights. He quoted a phrase that I have heard before but this time it struck me in a different way – “good is the enemy of great.” Read that again and let it sit in your gut for a minute – “good is the enemy of great.” How many times have you found yourself taking short cuts or giving up because it got harder than you expected? How much potential are you leaving on the table because “its good enough?” This week I’d like to challenge you ask yourself do I want to be good or do I want to be great? And fill in the blanks on whatever it is that you want to do in your life – learn to cook, spend more time with your kids, start a side hustle online selling your crafts – it doesn’t matter. What matters is what sets your soul on fire and drives you to be the best human being you can be. You can do it. I believe in you. Let’s make it a great week!

PS if you haven’t read or listened to the book Greenlights, I would highly recommend it!

Let Go by Dr. Billy Graham

A little child was playing one day with a very valuable vase. He put his hand into it and could not withdraw it. His father too, tried his best, but all in vain. They were thinking of breaking the vase when the father said, “Now, my son, make one more try. Open your hand and hold your fingers out straight as you see me doing, and then pull.”

To their astonishment the little fellow said, “O no, father. I couldn’t put my fingers out like that, because if I did, I would drop my penny.”

Smile, if you will–but thousands of us are like that little boy, so busy holding on to the world’s worthless penny that we cannot accept liberation. I beg you to drop the trifle in your heart. Surrender! Let Go!

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,049

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well and refreshed for a new week! Today I want to talk about fear – did you know that fear is the root to perfectionism, control and squashes more dreams than other emotion we experience? I want to empower you with a tool that has helped me over the years in regard to facing fear – the feeling of fear is the same emotion felt in the physical body as excitement – it all boils down to how we label what we are feeling! There is nothing perfect in life, and the only thing we can control is how we respond to what we are feeling. This week, I want to challenge you to start with plan A but be prepared for plan W – W for the win! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

There once was this criminal who had committed a crime

(Because, hey, that’s what criminals do. That’s their job!)

Anyway, he was sent to the king for his punishment.

The king told him he had a choice of two punishments.

He could be hung by a rope.

Or take what’s behind the big, dark, scary, mysterious iron door.

The criminal quickly decided on the rope.

As the noose was being slipped on him, he turned to the king and asked:

“By the way, out of curiosity, what’s behind that door?”

The king laughed and said:

“You know, it’s funny, I offer everyone the same choice, and nearly everyone picks the rope.”

“So,” said the criminal, “Tell me. What’s behind the door? I mean, obviously, I won’t tell anyone,” he said, pointing to the noose around his neck.

The king paused then answered:

“Freedom, but it seems most people are so afraid of the unknown that they immediately take the rope.”

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Today I want to talk about gratitude…and more specifically the gratitude I have for the thousands of clients we have had the pleasure of serving for thirty-five years in the Valley of the Sun. Gratitude for the more than 1,000 agents who have come through the doors at RE/MAX Professionals…some have stayed, others have moved on to a different brokerage or opened their own brick and mortar.

When I started out back in 1986 my goal was to supplement my income from the concrete labor job I was working at the time so I could take my family on a vacation to Disneyland and buy a big screen television. Little did I know the incredible opportunity that I was creating for myself, my family, my future team, and the impact my decision would have on countless lives that I have met over the year, helped buy or sell a home or mentored and coached to become a great real estate agent. When I think about it, I am overwhelmed by the amount of gratitude I have for those who trusted me, saw my vision and fearlessly followed me into unchartered waters. Today, this message is dedicated to each of you. And with the sincerest gratitude, I say THANK YOU. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

One day King came to his garden and saw withering and dying trees, bushes, and flowers.

An oak said it dies because it can’t be as high as a pine.

A pine tree was falling down because it could not give grapes like a grapevine.

Meanwhile the grapevine was dying because it couldn’t blossom like a rose.

But soon the King found a single plant, pleasing heart, bloomy and fresh.

The king asked: “All the trees and flowers here are withering, and you are flourishing, why?”

“I think it comes naturally. You have planted me, because it was your wish and your choice. If you would like to grow an oak, grapes or rose, you would plant them. And I cannot be anything else than what I am. So, I try to develop my best qualities.”

Moral of the story: Look at yourself. You can be only yourself. It is impossible for you to become someone else. You can enjoy life and blossom, or you can wither if you do not accept yourself.

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Happy President’s Day to each of you reading this email today! What a great day we are celebrating that is packed with history, tradition, and the sound of freedom – dating back to 1799. After the death of America’s first president, George Washington, his supporters began recognizing his birthday on February 22nd. His birthday became a federal holiday in the District of Columbia in 1879 and rest of the US in 1885. Fast forward a few years to 1971 when president Nixon issued an executive order that the third Monday in February would be recognized as President’s Day. While I know most of us enjoy the long weekend, I would like to encourage you to take a moment to reflect on the history of our great country and remember those who came before us so we can call ourselves Americans. Let’s make it a great day and a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

America the Beautiful by Katharine Lee Bates, 1893

O beautiful for spacious skies,For amber waves of grain,For purple mountain majestiesAbove the fruited plain!

America! America!God shed His grace on thee,And crown thy good with brotherhoodFrom sea to shining sea!

O beautiful for pilgrim feetWhose stern impassion’d stressA thoroughfare for freedom beatAcross the wilderness

America! America!God mend thine ev’ry flaw,Confirm thy soul in self-control,Thy liberty in law.

O beautiful for heroes prov’dIn liberating strife,Who more than self their country lov’d,And mercy more than life.

America! America!May God thy gold refineTill all success be nobleness,And ev’ry gain divine.

O beautiful for patriot dreamThat sees beyond the yearsThine alabaster cities gleamUndimmed by human tears.

America! America!God shed His grace on thee,And crown thy good with brotherhoodFrom sea to shining sea.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,046

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! This week I want to write about life – not life in general but life in the physical form; a human being living. I have come to realize that many of us, myself included we take for granted the unique and utterly amazing possibility of what it means to be alive. We take for granted the fact that to be alive is a rare, precious gift – a privilege that is denied to so many. We blow off the scientific proof that no one in our vast planet shares the same DNA, the same fingerprint, the same strand of hair.

Sadly, it is only when light that shines through our bodies is snuffed out, that we realize how little time there is – even if you live to be 93 like my sweet mother who recently left us. This week, I want to challenge you to stop for a moment and consider the possibilities of you existing in this great big world – how incredible it is to feel your lungs fill with air and to feel the beat of your heart as it pumps to keep you alive. Life is truly a gift and your bright light is proof of that – please don’t take it for granted. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Once an old man and a young man were sitting on the shore of a wild and stormy river.

“Master,” the student asked, “why does the time flow straight, but always ripples, either slowing down to a complete stop, or racing like a cow with a thistle under her tail?”

The teacher looked at the seething water and answered:

“You see there are a few large stones in the river and a lot of small pebbles. Imagine that the river is your life. If you will only rejoice over big occasions – like your wedding that will happen next month, or like a new baby that you will have after one year, or new business that you will start after five years…then you will cross your life in a few jumps, like jumping from one stone to another. Otherwise, if you will move in small paces over the pebbles, taking joy in small things: a sunny day, the beauty of autumn forest, a good conversation, then later looking back at your life you won’t see ten big stones, but lots of your own traces, and each of them you will be able to remember with a happy smile. And you will see that the road that you have crossed is much longer.”

“But teacher, when I love or when I do the work that I like or when I have a talk with friends – the time flies fast. But the time drags so long when I’m hurt, when I’m afraid or when I feel lonely.”

“You see,” the old man answered wistfully, “this is what it should be. When we are unhappy, we don’t live but we only exist, so the time lies still in our wallets. And only for our happiness we pay the ringing coin of time, that we still have left.”

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well and sticking to your New Year’s resolutions as we start a new month in 2021. It is about now that we’ve either succeed with sticking with our resolutions or completely given up. If you find yourself in the later, I would like to encourage you to revisit your resolutions – are they in alignment with who you are and are you clear about why you want to do them? And then I’d like to challenge you to re-commit. You do not have to wait for next January to start again. Today is a new day in a new month – you can do it. I believe in you! Let’s make it a great week!

PS today is also the start to Black History Month, which was established by President Gerald Ford in 1976. The president called upon us to seize the opportunity to honor and recognize the accomplishments of our fellow black Americans throughout history. I’d like to ask you to think about how you can contribute this month.

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

I will tell you a story of my friend Monty Roberts.

As he was a kid, his father as a horse trainer was moving from stable to stable, from ranch to ranch, training horses. Thus, the boy‘s school career was constantly interrupted. One day, when he was a senior, teacher asked him to write about what he wanted to be when he grew up. He did not hesitate a minute and wrote seven-page paper about his aim to be an owner of a horse ranch, he wrote many details and drew a location of buildings and stables and even a detailed house plan.

Two days later he received his paper back with letter F on the front page. After class he came to teacher and asked, “Why did I receive an F?“ The teacher responded, “This dreams is so unrealistic for a boy like you, who has no money, no resources and who comes from itinerant family. There is no possibility that you will reach your great goals one day.” Then the teacher offered to rewrite the paper with more realistic attitude.

The boy went home and asked his father, how he should act. The father answered: “This decision is very important for you. So you have to make your own mind on this.”

After several days the boy brought the same paper to his teacher. No changes were made. He said, “Keep the F and I will keep my dream.”

Now Monty Roberts owns 4,000-square-foot house in the middle of 200-acre horse ranch and he still has that school paper, which now is framed over the fireplace.

Remember, you have to follow your heart, never give up, move on with determination and persistence, and never let anyone take your dreams away.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,043

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! We are halfway through the first month of the New Year – how is it going so far? Today I want to write about time and more importantly time management – for years we have focused on managing time, to only realize that we can’t actually manage time. Every day the sun comes up and goes down leaving us with a mere twenty-four hours in the day to live a life on purpose. What can we do instead to be effective with our limited hours in each day? We can focus our efforts on how and what we are doing, who we are spending it with and what we say yes or no to.

This week I’d like to challenge you to be aware of what you are doing with your day – perhaps limit the amount of time you spend on social media, and instead go for a walk with your family. Maybe skip the news for a couple days and pick up a book you’ve been meaning to read. Or perhaps its time to hire the housekeeper you have been wanting so you don’t have to spend your only days off cleaning the house. Challenge every minutes of your day to ensure you are spending it wisely on things that help you life your life on purpose. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

That One Time by Rick Baldwin

If I could slice a still instant out of moving life,

I would carve an ample piece of that one time,

And place it under a crystal dome

Gazing daily at its deliciousness until temptation finally breaks me,

And I bust it from its detention,

Devouring it like a brown bear at a honey tree.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Time and tide wait for no man.” - Geoffrey Chaucer

“Time is the coin of your life. It is the only coin you have, and only you can determine how it will be spent. Be careful lest you let other people spend it for you.” - Carl Sandburg

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,042

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Today I want to take a moment to thank each person who donated to the food drive we co-hosted with Motto Mortgage to support our local St. Mary’s Food Bank. As we all know, the food banks have been taxed this year with the pandemic and we are so grateful to have contributed 4,628 meals last week. There was 1,521 pounds of food donated and cash that will feed our neighbors in need. They say it takes a village – and we are blessed to be among so many gracious and generous people. THANK YOU!

When we give, we do more than the actual giving of money or the can of beans from our pantry – we make a difference. This week I’d like to encourage you to look for a way you can make a difference, even if it’s as simple as a can of beans or a kind gesture to a strange. Let’s make a difference together – and make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

The 5 Minute Rule

When you are about to abandon a task because you’ve had enough or feel you aren’t getting anywhere or are just bored then try applying the “5 Minute Rule.” Say to yourself I will stick at it for just 5 minutes more and then I can give up or take a break.

At the worst you get 5 minutes work done and at the best you will have found a second wind, got focused and become productive. Of course, what you are aiming for is to move into The Zone when suddenly work becomes effortless, the words just flow, the paperwork gets dealt with, you make that call you’ve been dreading, nothing seems a problem. But imagine if you hadn’t applied the five-minute trick you might have never got there you might have gone and switched the television on and watched a replay of the ballgame!

You can use the 5-minute-more trick in the Gym as well or when doing jobs in the house. I actually hear my lazy inner self thinking up excellent reasons why I should abandon my endeavor, you’ve had a long day, mustn’t tire myself out for tomorrow, it’s too cold or hot or windy and the craftiest one shouldn’t you be doing another task altogether.

Remember the other 5-minute rule that we often want to give up a task after just 5 minutes, 5 minutes into writing an essay or starting a run that’s the danger time before we’ve warmed to the task before we see any progress, you can use the five-minute rule to help you through this discouraging phase.

Go on, do five minutes more…

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,041

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I will admit this past week has been somewhat unproductive, and while the yummy holiday food and sweets were a welcomed delight, especially this year, I found myself overindulging. On top of the fact, I haven’t felt a hundred percent, which led my mind to think the worst – could it be Covid-19? Its funny how the mind can go straight to the worst-case scenario! I am not trying to make any excuses; however, my family has been directly impacted by the virus as someone I love dearly has been in and out of the hospital over the holiday with Covid and pneumonia. Anxiety + worry + overindulging = not a good mental place.

This week has been a reminder how important good health really is – and that is why I am committing to the 75 Hard Program starting today. I want to get my mind set strong so I can focus on both health and business. I would like to invite you to join me on a journey that changes your habits and your life – if you don’t know what the 75 Hard Program is, you can Google it (#75Hard), or give me a call. Let’s get healthy both physically and mentally together – and make it a great week!  

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

You may think that you are completely insignificant in this world. But someone drinks coffee from their favorite cup that you gave them. Someone heard a song on the radio that reminded them of you. Someone read a book that you recommended and plunged headfirst into it. Someone smiled after a hard day of work because they remembered the joke that you told them today. Someone loves themselves a little bit more because you gave them a compliment. Never think that you have no influence whatsoever. Your touch, word, and good deed which you leave behind, can not be erased.

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope that each of you reading this email had a lovely holiday weekend however you chose to spend it! There are only a few days left in 2020 and I want to be the first to wish you a happy New Year.

I will be celebrating the New Year with a deep gratitude for each agent who chooses RE/MAX Professionals as their brokerage and the many families we were able to serve this year with their real estate needs. I am truly a blessed man to be surrounded by so many amazing people, my loving family and my real estate crew both on my team and those who help me run the brokerage. From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU, and Happy New Year! Let’s make it a great week!

Candlelit Heart

Somewhere across the winter world tonightYou will be hearing chimes that fill the air;Christmas extends its all-enfolding lightAcross the distance…something we can share.

You will be singing, just the same as I,These familiar songs we know so well,And you will see these same stars in your skyAnd wish upon that brightest one that fell.

I shall remember you and trim my tree,One shining star upon the topmost bough;I will hang wreaths of faith that all may seeTonight I glimpse beyond the hear and now.

And all the time that we must be apartI keep a candle in my heart.

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I want to thank each of you who came out Saturday or donated online to support the food drive we hosted with our partners at Motto Mortgage. The food banks always need our help, however this year there is an extra need. So, a big thank you!!!

I wanted to share a thought I had the other day in today’s message. Each of us are unique, in fact so unique that not one person has the same DNA, thumb print or strand of hair. Each person has a unique set of gifts and abilities that leave an imprint on the world around us; the light you shine makes a difference. To be alive on planet earth today, is truly a miracle. However, the time we have is limited which makes each day a precious gift that shouldn’t be wasted. The world needs your light. Let it shine. Let’s make it a great week!

The Story of Two Wolves

An old Cherokee is teaching his grandson about life. “A fight is going on inside me,” he said to the boy. “It is a terrible fight, and it is between two wolves. One is evil – he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority and ego.”

He continued, “The other is good – he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. The same fight tis going on inside you – and inside every other person, too.”

The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather, “Which wolf will win?”

The old Cherokee simply replied, “The one you feed.”

“I will not follow where the path may lead, but I will go where there is no path, and I will leave a trail.” - Muriel Strode

The Christmas Tree Angel from Michigan

When Michigan resident Chad Rose just happened to have an extra Christmas tree that was used on his business’s parade float, he did what any decent person would do: he posted on Craigslist to give it away for free. For some, a tree is an annual necessity and integral part of the holidays, but for many it’s an expense that needs to be saved for daily essentials. After posting the ad, his inbox was immediately flooded with touching stories of why various families deserved to have the tree.

With each e-mail he read, it became clear how significant a simple tree can be in contributing to the holiday aura. One email, which he shared with MLive.com, read, “Having a real Christmas tree would be such a great blessing this year [because] usually we draw a Christmas tree on a large poster and hang it in the corner.” Realizing that $25 towards a tree was too much for some families to spare, Chad went out and bought 40 more to give away for free. He spent most of the next day going over his list of emails, checking it twice, and not paying much attention to who’s been naughty or nice – just deserving.

But the good holiday spirit in this story doesn’t stop there — Ann Posont of East Grand Rapids read Rose’s Ad and contacted him, not to get, but to give. She offered to donate ornaments and other trimming for the 40 trees he had picked up.

“Going out to gather up more trees after realizing the impact it would have on those in need is just so generous,” she said. “It tells a lot about his character, and makes you want to help.”

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I trust that each of you reading this had a relaxing, safe and healthy holiday weekend. We are on the final stretch of 2020 and I know for many of us, we can’t wait to put 2020 behind us! However, as we are navigating the pandemic, we are also facing a stressful time of year for many – the holiday season – and this year, we can agree it will look a lot different despite our creative and unique ideas to keep our annual traditions. This week, I’d like to encourage you to take a deep breath and remember that kindness and compassion go a long way. As always, let’s make it a great week!

Paid in Full With a Glass of Milk, a true Story of Kindness

The year was 1863 and one day, a poor boy by the name of Howard Kelly was selling goods door to door to pay his way through school. After a full day of working hard he figured he had only a little bit of change left, but to little to get some food. Like many days before he had been hungry for the most part of the day. He hoped to make at least some sales to get enough money for food and to put some money on the side for his tuition next year. After going through some scenarios in his mind he was hoping for some kindness from the people living in the next house where he decided to ask for a meal. As he approached the door and rang the bell he was determined to not only ask for food but to make a sale at the end.

However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. So instead of a meal, he asked for a glass of water. The woman remembered seeing this young boy many times working hard going up and down the streets knocking on doors. Almost everyone in the neighborhood knew his story and that many times instead of selling to people he helped them with their chores. She thought he looked hungry so she brought him a large glass of milk instead of water. The boy drank it slowly and then asked how much he owes.

“You don’t owe me anything,” she replied. “I know you helped many people in our neighborhood. Mother has taught us that kindness is repaid with kindness.” You could see a bit of relief and happiness as he replied, “Then I thank you from my heart.” Right there and then Howard felt stronger and more confident as he found some hope in the kind actions of the young woman. He continued on with his work feeling recharged by a mear smile, some words and a full glass of milk.

Year’s later that young woman became critically ill. The local doctors were baffled. They finally sent her to the big city, where they called in specialists to study her rare disease. Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation. When he heard the name of the town she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. Immediately he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room.

Dressed in his doctor’s gown he went in to see her. He recognized her at once and remembered the kindness she showed him that day and how much that helped him. He went back to the consultation room determined to do his best to save her life. From that day he gave special attention to the case. After a long struggle, the battle was won. Dr. Howard requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the edge and the bill was sent to her room.

She feared to open it, for she was sure it would take the rest of her life to pay for it all. Finally, she looked, and something caught her attention on the side of the bill. She began to read the following words, “PAID IN FULL WITH ONE GLASS OF MILK. SIGNED, DR. Howard Kelly.”

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,035

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Well, Thanksgiving is upon us and let me be the first to wish you and your loved ones a very happy, healthy and safe celebration. As we navigate these unique times, I hope that you will find gratitude in even the smallest of ways, from a sparkling light that dances off your favorite crystal, to the pets under your feet while you roast the turkey, or from the laughs and voices that stream through the Zoom call with your family as you connect 2020-style. In every diversity we can find something to be grateful for, grace, compassion, strength and above all, love. From my family and team to yours, Happy Thanksgiving! Let’s make it a great week!

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! We are quickly approaching the holiday season and while I know its going to look a lot different for many of us, there is still plenty to celebrate and be grateful for. I’d love to hear from you this week as to how you plan to celebrate! I know there are unique ideas popping up every day and people finding ways to connect despite the pandemic, and I’d love to what you are planning to do. Let’s continue to focus our thoughts and actions on what we have to be grateful for and continue to be a bright light in our community and for our family and friends. And as always, let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

There are two branches of Gratitude. One is Gratefulness, and the other is Thanksgiving.

The Gratefulness branch is when the Bowl of Life is so full that it’s almost overflowing, but not quite. So full that it’s almost bowed at the top, but not quite dribbling over the edges. And, that is the experience of the Great Fullness of Life.

And when you’re in the Great Fullness of Life, you’re one with God, you’re one with the Universe, there is no “other.” And that is so Full Filling, that the Bowl of Life gives way and to overflow at last, which flows you directly over to the second branch, that of Thanksgiving.

When you’re in the space of Thanksgiving, the Bowl of Life is absolutely overflowing. You’re so grateful that there is an “other” because all you want to do is contribute and serve and share and give and make a difference. And that is so full-filling, that it puts you right back onto the other branch where you experience the Great Fullness of Life, where you’re one with God and there is no “other.”

And, so you see, you can live your whole life in the two branches of Gratitude…

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! What a week it has been for our great country – I hope that each of you reading this are safe and well – and ready to start another week as we round out 2020. I have been in the real estate industry for nearly 35 years, and one thing I know for certain, is that no matter who is in the White House, people still need assistance with their real estate needs. And we will remain committed to providing the excellent service you have come to expect, whether you are a client reading this or an agent in our brokerage or community.

We value our relationships and now more than ever we want you to know how much we appreciate you, your referrals and the loyalty of the agents who chose RE/MAX Professionals as their home. This week, I’d like to ask each of you to pay it forward – our world needs love and kindness so let’s be the light. Please make an extra effort to be that – hold a door open for an elder person at the store, call someone you haven’t talked to in a long time, help your neighbor with the weeds in their yard – whatever it might be, let’s do something that is an act of kindness in our community. And as always, let’s make it a great week!

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Its finally feeling like fall in the Valley of the Sun and just in time for the spooky ghouls and goblins who only come out during Halloween! I know that things look a little different this year for most of us leading into the holiday season, however, I want to remind you that we still have much to be grateful for. Instead of focusing on what we can’t do, let’s make it an opportunity to find unique and creative ways to celebrate while navigating the current climate. Let’s make it a great week – happy Halloween!

Mystic Magination Night! Written by Patricia L. Cisco

On one mystic, magic night,Jack O Lanterns glowingwith bags of candy sweet,roam door to door and street to street,all dressed up for trick or treat!

Wizards with wands, pirates with hooks,monsters and clowns with spooky looks,

kings and queens with capes and crowns,a princess in her royal gown,

witches with warts and fairies with wingsmovies stars with sparkling rings,

vampires with fangs that bite,ghost that boo all dressed in white.

Imaginations taken flight,on that one mystic, magic night.

Oh, the fun of Halloween,be young or old or in between!

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope that you found time this week to practice a little self-care and that you are ready to embrace another week. It’s hard to believe that there are only 73 more days left in 2020! I know many of us are counting the days before we hit the New Year, however, I’d like to challenge you to use this time wisely, because we will never get it back. And while I know that 2020 has been full of unexpected and unprecedented events, there is still a life to be lived, countless opportunities and plenty of abundance and happiness if we look for it. Let’s make every single minute count! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

The Elephant Rope

As a man was passing the elephants, he suddenly stopped, confused by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg. No chains, no cages. It was obvious that the elephants could, at any time, break away from their bonds but for some reason, they did not.

He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away. “Well,” trainer said, “when they are very young and much smaller, we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.”

The man was amazed. These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they couldn’t, they were stuck right where they were.

Like the elephants, how many of us go through life hanging onto a belief that we cannot do something, simply because we failed at it once before?

Moral of the story: No matter how much the world tries to hold you back, always continue with the belief that what you want to achieve is possible.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“We have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak.” – Epictetus

“I say what I want to say and do what I want to do. There’s no in between. People will either love you for it or hate you for it.” – Eminem

“No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and he’s not the same man.” -Heraclitus

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well and refreshed from the weekend. We have spent a few weeks now talking about opportunities and taking inventory of the year so far and there is still time to crush your goals in Q4. However today, I want to remind you about the importance of practicing self-care. There is a lot coming at us from all different directions, and emotions and stress levels are on high alert. Taking time each day to take care of you first is critical. There is a reason that they flight attendants tell you to put your mask on first, in the event of an emergency before helping those around you. If you can’t breathe, you can’t help anyone else, especially your loved ones. I challenge each of you to take fifteen minutes each day this week and practice self-care! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

God Make Me a TV

Students at an elementary school were asked to write an essay about what they would like God to do for them. At the end of the day, while grading the essays, a teacher read one that made her very emotional.

Her husband, who had just walked in, saw her crying and asked her “What happened?” She answered “Read this. It is one of my school’s students’ essays:”

“Oh God, tonight I ask you something very special. Make me into a television set. I want to take its place and live like the TV in my house.

Have my own special place, and have my family around me. To be taken seriously when I talk. I want to be the center of attention and be heard without interruptions or questions.

I want to receive the same special care as the TV set receives even when it is not working. Have the company of my dad when he arrives home from work, even when he is tired. And I want my mom to want me when she is sad and upset, instead of ignoring me. And I want my brothers to fight to be with me.

I want to feel that family just leaves everything aside, every now and then, just to spend some time with me. And last but not least, ensure that I can make them all happy and entertain them. Lord I don’t ask you for much. I just want to live like a TV.”

At that moment the husband said “My God, poor kid. What horrible parents!”

The wife looked up at him and said, “That essay is our son’s!”

I hope this email finds you well and ready to take on another fresh and new week – and perhaps we have seen the last of the triple digits here in the Valley of the Sun! This week I’d like to challenge each of you to think about one thing you can do to make a difference in your life, in your family’s life, in your community, in your business. Amid the chaos and stress of day to day life, what is one thing you can do to bring a little joy and happiness? What is just one thing that leaves the world a better place? Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Just One - Unknown

One song can spark a moment,One flower can wake the dreamOne tree can start a forest, One bird can herald spring.One smile begins a friendship,One handclasp lifts a soul.One star can guide a ship at sea,One word can frame the goalOne vote can change a nation, one sunbeam lights a roomOne candle wipes out darkness,One laugh will conquer gloom.One step must start each journey.One word must start each prayer.One hope will raise our spirits,One touch can show you care.One voice can speak with wisdom,One heart can know what’s true,One life can make a difference,You see, it’s up to you!

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,027

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope that you had a wonderful weekend, filled with whatever activities that bring you joy and an opportunity to rest and relax in preparation for the new week. While the temperatures are continuing to set new records, the mornings here in the desert have been a long-awaited breath of fresh, cooler air. I hope you have enjoyed a little more time outside this last week!

The last quarter of 2020 starts this week – are you ready? Last week we talked about taking inventory of this year so far, and this week I’d like to encourage you to think about the last few weeks of the year. What would it take to make them the best they can be? What goals can you still accomplish in the next 90 days? There is still time – make it count. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

A professor of philosophy came into his class. He brought some items with him and put them on the table. When the class began, he took a large transparent empty jar and started to fill it with rather massive stones. Then the professor asked his students: “Is the jar full?” They confirmed that it was.

Now the professor picked up a box of small pebbles, poured them into the jar and shook it, so that pebbles filled the open areas between the rocks. He asked once again: “Is the jar full?” They agreed that it was.

This time the professor poured a bucket of sand into the jar, and the sand filled up everything else.

“Now,“ said the professor, “I want you to see that this jar is just like your life – the stones are the most important things, your main values – your family, health, morality.

The pebbles are other things that matter – your job, house and car. The sand represents the small stuff.

So, if you put the sand into the jar first, there would be no place left for pebbles and large stones. Therefore pay most of your attention to the things, that are the most important in life – spend enough time with your family, take care of your health and don‘t forget to develop spiritually – be kind, honest, sensitive, helpful. These are the things that really matter. They should be your priorities. The rest is just sand.”

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,026

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope this email finds you healthy and in good spirits as we prepare to embrace a new week. Its almost the end of the third quarter and tomorrow marks the first official day of fall. Although, here in Phoenix the lingering triple digit temperatures make it a little difficult to get excited about pumpkins and apple spice! However, fall is a perfect time to take inventory of the year so far, reflect on what went right, what could be improved on and what success looks like for 2021.

I want to stress the importance of focusing on what went right this year – I know for many of us there was plenty that happened around the pandemic which has caused an immense amount of stress and anxiety – but I would like to challenge you to find the positives, the silver linings and the moments that brought joy to your life. What we focus on, grows. What we pay attention to, is our reality. If we want to feel better, we need to focus on what makes us feel better. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

One day two woodcutters have argued, which of them will cut more wood during a day. In the morning two men took up their positions. First, they worked at one speed. But in an hour one of them has heard, that the other one stopped cutting trees. Realizing that this was his chance, the first woodcutter started to cut trees with double efforts.

Ten minutes passed, and he heard that the second woodcutter started to work again. They were working almost synchronously, when the first woodcutter heard that his opponent has stopped again. The first woodcutter continued working, feeling the smell of victory.

This lasted all day long. Each hour one of the woodcutters stopped for ten minutes and the other one continued to work. When time expired, the first woodcutter, who worked without any stopping, was absolutely sure that he won the prize.

He was very surprised to know that was mistaken. How did that happen? He asked his partner, “Each hour I heard that you have stopped the work for ten minutes. How could you cut more trees than I? It’s impossible!”

“It is very simple, in fact,” answered the second woodcutter. “Each hour I stopped the work for ten minutes. And when you were cutting the trees, I sharpened the axe.”

Here’s my latest full conversation with my good friend Travis Zimmerman.

I recently had the opportunity to sit down with Travis Zimmerman of One Guard Home Warranty to talk about several different topics. 

He got a text recently from a good friend at a home warranty company who said that July 2020 was their best revenue month in the history of the company. However, it was also the lowest profit margin that they’ve ever had. Due to scarcity, the frequency of claims is up, replace versus repair is up, and the average cost per claim is up.

“Travis continues to help me and my clients achieve our goals.”

I know great service, and Travis Zimmerman is a great service provider. I remember back when he was doing repairs in Sun City, got into the property management world, and how he continues to help me and our clients to this day.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope each of you reading this had a restful weekend and that you are ready to tackle another week. Fortunately, it looks like the cooler temps are on their way! And let’s send our friends in the PacWest good vibes for low winds and some much-needed rain to help the firefighters battle the flames. Our thoughts are with all of those impacted by the wildfires!

As we approach Q4 of 2020, I’d like to challenge you to revisit your goals and aspirations for this year – what have you done so far? What can you still do in the remaining weeks? What goals need to be revised and refreshed? Every day we have a unique opportunity – let’s not waste it! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

The King’s Roadblock, Author unknown.

In ancient times, a king had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock.

Some of the king’s wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it. Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about getting the big stone out of the way.

Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables. On approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded.

As the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway.

The peasant learned what many others never understand: Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve one’s condition once you make the effort.

It Couldn’t Be Done by Edgar Guest

Somebody said it couldn’t be done,But he with a chuckle repliedThat “maybe it couldn’t,” but he would be oneWho wouldn’t say so till he’d tried.So he buckled right in with the trace of a grinOn his face. If he worried he hid it.He started to sing and he tackled the thingThat couldn’t be done, and he did it.

Somebody scoffed: “Oh, you’ll never do that;At least no one has ever done it”;But he took off his coat and he took of his hat,And the first thing we knew he’d begun it.With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,Without any doubting or quiddit,He started to sing and he tackled the thingThat couldn’t be done, and he did it.

There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,There are thousands to prophesy failure;There are thousands to point out to you, one by one,The dangers that wait to assail you.But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,Just take off your coat and go to it;Just start to sing as you tackle the thingThat “cannot be done,” and you’ll do it.

Freon is being phased out of the HVAC industry; what does this mean for us?

Three to five years ago people began discussing the phasing out of freon in the HVAC industry. Today, Travis Zimmerman and I are discussing this topic in more detail. We’re exploring the implications of this, the cost to homeowners, whether or not to update your system, and more.

Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in the video. Feel free to watch the full message, or use these timestamps to browse specific topics at your leisure: 

0:00: Introduction to today’s topic

0:25: What should we know about our current AC units?

3:00: Should people be asking what type of system is in a house when shopping for a home?

5:15: Does this mean that eventually the supply of freon will be gone?

6:15: Wrapping up today’s topic

If you have any questions about freon or real estate in general, reach out via phone or email. I would be glad to help you.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,023

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Its August 31st and that means it is the last day of the Month of Miracles! I want to thank each of you who generously donated this month to our goal of $20,000 to benefit our beloved Phoenix Children’s Hospital. In these uncertain times, I know some of you might be struggling financially and that is one of the reasons why this year was so important for us to fundraise. The hospital has moved quickly to adapt to the new needs of sick kids and their families, and we were able to assist with those demands by our donations – THANK YOU! As you go through this week, I’d like you to look for ways that you can make a difference – its not always about donating pennies, but maybe it’s a warm smile to a stranger, a long over due phone call, or helping your neighbor. What we give makes a difference. Let’s make it a great week!

PS We have one more fundraising opportunity going on through today. We have three awesome raffle items up for grabs and all you have to do is post a comment with your bid amount and we’ll announce the winners on the 31st. Click here to see the raffle items. You can also donate online here: https://rem.ax/PCHPros2020.



ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Believing in You, By Catherine Pulsifer

Never stop believing in yourself. When others doubt, don’t you. 

Do what you love to do, No one knows better than you.

Life is too short to live others’ dreams Follow your own dream 

Push yourself to reach your goals And live the life you once dreamed.

Trust your instincts. Be true to yourself. 

You know what is right for you. Never give up or give in.

Forget the words “I don’t know how.” You can learn, you can research, you can do.

Your mind is powerful. When you believe you can. 

You will find a way You won’t waste a day.

Persist and persevere. Do not fear Because if you believe in you 

You will find dreams can come true.May all your dreams turn into goals, Believe in yourself. 

And remember, all of life is a choice. The decision is up to you.

Believe in Yourself,Dare to be whatever you want to be!

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,022

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope this email finds you well and staying hydrated from the summer temps! I don’t know about you, but our family enjoyed the storm the other night and hope for more before the monsoon season comes to an end. It has definitely been a very warm summer here in the Valley of the Sun. As we navigate the excessive heat, back to school struggles and pandemic, I want to challenge you to take a deep breath before you respond, especially on social media. Its okay to practice the pause before you respond to someone or something – the pause gives us time to collect our thoughts, evaluate our feelings and find a bit of compassion. This week let’s practice the pause together and make it a great week!

PS We have broken the $15,000 mark towards our goal of $20,000 to benefit the Month of Miracles – THANK YOU for your donations and support! We have one more fundraising opportunity going on through August 31st at 5pm. We have three awesome raffle items up for grabs and all you have to do is post a comment with your bid amount and we’ll announce the winners on the 31st. Click here to see the raffle items. You can also donate online here: https://rem.ax/PCHPros2020.

PSS You are also invited to join us for a FREE CE class, Managing the Home Inspection happening on Wednesday, August 26th at 9am. See the flyer below for more information, and click here to RSVP. All proceeds will be donated to the Phoenix Children’s Hospital!



ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

A group of frogs were traveling through the woods, and two of them fell into a deep pit. When the other frogs saw how deep the pit was, they told the two frogs that they were as good as dead. The two frogs ignored the comments and tried to jump up out of the pit with all their might. The other frogs kept telling them to stop, that they were as good as dead. Finally, one of the frogs took heed to what the other frogs were saying and gave up. He fell down and died.The other frog continued to jump as hard as he could. Once again, the crowd of frogs yelled at him to stop the pain and just die. He jumped even harder and finally made it out. When he got out, the other frogs said, “Did you not hear us?” The frog explained to them that he was deaf. He thought they were encouraging him the entire time.

This story teaches two lessons:

1. There is power of life and death in the tongue. An encouraging word to someone who is down can lift them up and help them make it through the day.

2. A destructive word to someone who is down can be what it takes to kill them. Be careful of what you say.

Speak life to those who cross your path. The power of words…it is sometimes hard to understand that an encouraging word can go such a long way. Anyone can peak words that tend to rob another of the spirit to continue in difficult times. Special is the individual who will take the time to encourage another. Author Unknown

        <description>

Just like all industries, the home warranty business has adapted to COVID.

COVID has affected every facet of our lives, and real estate is no different. What about the home warranty business, though? With more and more people working from home, home warranty providers are experiencing an unprecedented number of claims. Today I’m joined by my friend and home warranty specialist Travis Zimmerman to explain how they’ve adapted to the situation. 

Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in the video. Feel free to watch it in its entirety, or use these timestamps to browse specific points at your leisure: 

1:07—COVID’s impact on Travis’ business from a people perspective 

2:07—COVID’s impact from a service/delivery perspective 

3:24—How much higher has demand been for home warranties and service contractors? 

5:23—How Stream has helped them performed diagnostic work 

As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic, or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m happy to help.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,021

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Today, I would like to thank those of you who tuned into our live streaming Give-A-Thon to benefit the Month of Miracles on Friday evening. It was a fun hour of great musical entertainment, and we raised over $11,000 towards our goal of $20,000 for Phoenix Children’s Hospital! I also want to thank the band, Throwing Fitz for their willingness to step outside the box and perform in unchartered territory – our world has changed, and we are blessed to be surrounded by individuals who are willing to innovate and adapt – we couldn’t do what we do without those folks, so thank you! There are still two weeks left in the Month of Miracles, which means you can still help us with our goal by donating at https://rem.ax/PCHPros2020. Let’s make it a great week! 

PS You are also invited to join us for a FREE CE class, Solar and Real Estate: What you need to know happening on Thursday, August 20th at 9am. See the flyer below for more information, and click here to RSVP.



ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

 

A Creed to Live By

Don’t undermine your worth by comparing yourself with others. It is because we are different that each of us is special.

Don’t set your goals by what other people deem important. Only you know what is best for you.

Don’t take for granted the things closest to your heart. Cling to them as you would your life, for without them life is meaningless.

Don’t let your life slip through your fingers by living in the past or for the future. By living your life one day at a time, you live all the days of your life.

Don’t give up when you still have something to give. Nothing is really over until the moment you stop trying.

Don’t be afraid to admit that you are less than perfect. It is this fragile thread that binds us to each other.

Don’t be afraid to encounter risks. It is by taking chances that we learn how to be brave.

Don’t shut love out of your life by saying it’s impossible to find. The quickest way to receive love is to give love. The fastest way to lose love is to hold it too tightly; and the best way to keep love is to give it wings.

Don’t dismiss your dreams. To be without dreams is to be without hope; to be without hope is to be without purpose.

Don’t run through life so fast that you forget not only where you’ve been, but also where you’re going. Life is not a race, but a journey to be savored each step of the way.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,020

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I want to give a big shout out to all the kids, parents and teachers who survived the first week of “virtual” school – and for those of you who might be starting this week. I know in my house, the first day of school for Mila was a lot different than last year, and certainly not what we had hoped for this year. However, challenges like this give us an opportunity to think outside the box, innovate, adapt, and overcome – but not without some patience and grace. This week let’s focus on taking a deep breath in those overwhelming moments and practicing the art of patience. We are in this together. Let’s make it a great week! 

PS You are Invited! Please mark your calendar for Friday, August 14th at 5pm so you can join us for a live streaming concert featuring local talent, Throwing Fitz to benefit our fundraising efforts which will support Phoenix Children’s Hospital for the Month of Miracles. Click here to RSVP! Because this is virtual, we would also like you to extend the invitation to your family, friends and anyone who might enjoy a fun filled evening of music right from the comfort of their home!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

PATIENCE written by Oguh Stanley

PATIENCE is one virtue so rareThat is often missing in our daily affair

PATIENCE is a companion of wisdomHe who has it stands among kings in any kingdomIt is an habit that cannot be thrown out of the windowWithout it lives you in a place of limbo

PATIENCE is not just how long we waitBut how we behave while we waitIt is a virtue of grace put together to make a pretty faceOne year of patience equals ten years of peace

PATIENCE is the key to contentmentThat locks every gate of resentmentOne ounce of patience is more than pounds of brainsInvesting in the bank of patience yield no loss but more gains

PATIENCE makes lighter what impatience may not healDriving through a narrow road but on a balance wheelA heart fuel with patience drives with an unseen speedIt might be a soar fruit but with a sweet seed

PATIENCE is truly a virtue acquire it if you canIt will make you a good father, a better mother and a perfect human

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“I think the teaching profession contributes more to the future of our society than any other single profession.” - John Wooden

“A good teacher can inspire hope, ignite the imagination, and instill a love of learning.” - Brad Henry

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I hope this email finds you refreshed and ready to bring on a new week full of new opportunities (and hopefully lower temperatures!). Every day is a new opportunity, despite the challenges we face in our world right now. There is always something to be grateful for, something to be excited about and something worthy of sharing because it makes a positive difference. As we prepare ourselves for the return of school (however that may look), I encourage you to practice good self-care, take a break from the news, eat well, get plenty of sleep and keep yourself hydrated. Let’s make it a great week! 

PS You are Invited! Please mark your calendar for Friday, August 14th at 5pm so you can join us for a live streaming concert featuring local talent, Throwing Fitz to benefit our fundraising efforts which will support Phoenix Children’s Hospital for the Month of Miracles.

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Echo or Life

“A son and his father were walking on the mountains. Suddenly, his son falls, hurts himself and screams, “AAAhhhhhhhhhhh!” To his surprise, he hears a voice repeating, somewhere in the mountain, “AAAhhhhhhhhhhh!” Curious, he yells, “Who are you?” He receives the answer, “Who are you?” Angered at the response, he screams, “Coward!” He receives the answer, “Coward!”

He looks to his father and asks, “What’s going on?” The father smiles and says, “My son, pay attention.” And then he screams to the mountain, “I admire you!” The voice answers, “I admire you!” Again, the father screams, “You are a champion!” The voice answers, “You are a champion!” 

The boy is surprised but does not understand. Then the father explains, “People call this echo, but really this is life. It gives you back everything you say or do. Our life is simply a reflection of our actions. If you want more love in the world, create more love in your heart. If you want more competence in your team, improve your competence. This relationship applies to everything, in all aspects of life; Life will give you back everything you have given to it.”

“Your life is not a coincidence. It’s a reflection of you!”  - Unknown Author

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.” - Maya Angelou

“Everyone has inside of him a piece of good news. The good news is that you don’t know how great you can be! How much you can love! What you can accomplish! And what your potential is!” - Anne Frank

“We must let go of the life we have planned, so as to accept the one that is waiting for us.” - Joseph Campbell

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,018

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Throughout the month of August RE/MAX’s corporate office and agents across the U.S. and Canada will participate in a variety of activities designed to bring awareness to the need children’s hospital have for donations. As many of you know, our office and agents are heavily involved in supporting our local Phoenix Children’s Hospital, and we have raised more than $500,000 since 2001.

We considered not hosting the Month of Miracles this year due to the pandemic, however the sick kids being treated at PCH has not stopped because of Covid-19. Last year we raised over $22,000 and we will continue the goal of Two Million Pennies this year, however its going to look a little different. Instead of hosting a series of Friday events to fund raise, we are taking it to a virtual setting and we are excited to announce our first ever streaming live concert with local talent, Throwing Fitz (big thank you to our very own Rick Ramirez who offered to share his band’s talents with us!).

Please mark your calendar for Friday, August 14th at 5pm. Because this is virtual, we would also like you to extend the invitation to your family, friends and anyone who might enjoy a fun filled evening of music right from the comfort of their home! We will be fundraising throughout the concert and may even have some raffle prizes for the top donors. Please keep your eye out for the details on the virtual event coming soon. Let’s make it a great week! 

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Thank you for the gift of life,For letting me be me,For all that I can know by wordsAnd all that I can see.

For all the music I can hearAnd all the songs I sing,For all the joy that comes to meAnd all the joy I bring.

For all the food that I can tasteAnd all the sweet scents smell,For all the loved one I can touch,Who love and wish me well.

For all the beauty of the world,Ever fresh and new,I don’t know who else I can thank,And so I’m thanking you.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,017

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message and another week filled with countless opportunities! I hope that you were able to recharge over the weekend and that each of you reading this is healthy and safe. I found the poem below while preparing for this email, and I thought it was relevant for the climate we are in. There is no goal to extreme…Let’s make it a great week! 

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

The Workings of a Successful Mind by Devin McMillan, 

The powers of the mind are not fixedand science can never explainWhat makes a person a successyet leaves another so mundane.

For whatever the mind can conceivewith enough thought it will deliver.There is no goal too extremewhen your mind is a benevolent giver.

Take risks in your daily lifeor you can conform like the restSince rewards are only granted tothose who have passed this test.

Know that you have the powerto succeed in numerous waysOr you can play it safebeing mediocre for all of your days.

So keep positive in all you dowielding your list of goals in handFear not what others sayjust focus on your plan.

Enjoy every breath that passesand every task there is to doSince your actions will only playthe goals you have placed in cue.

And always remember to gifta little of everything you makeFor life is defined by givingand never by what you take.

Here’s what you need to help your clients understand about forbearance.

The C.A.R.E.S Act provides all homeowners who have lost their jobs due to COVID-19 with the ability to apply for forbearance. In short, forbearance is an agreement between a borrower and their mortgage provider that states the borrower will reduce or delay your mortgage payments for up to 12 months.

To pay back the reduced or delayed payments, the mortgage provider could add them back to each of your monthly payments until the deficit is covered, or it could be added to the back end of the loan, extending the loan period.

“Your client will need to explain their hardship and provide paperwork showing that they’ve lost income, but overall, it’s a simple process.”

If one of your clients is applying for forbearance, advise them to contact their mortgage company, who should already have information packets, and help guide them through the process. 

One great thing is that the C.A.R.E.S Act states that it won’t affect your clients’ credit scores, but I’d recommend that your clients start checking their credit as soon as they get their forbearance agreement. Right now, through Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, you can get a free annual credit report, or you can also visit www.AnnualCreditReport.com to sign up for a weekly credit report up until April 2021.

For more useful information to pass on to your clients regarding forbearance, click here.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,016

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…I hope this email finds you ready to brave another week of summer temps as we set records here in the desert valley (a little summer humor for you below). While we navigate the heat, there is still plenty we can do to live our lives to the fullest and pursue our goals and dreams with passion. What is one thing you can do this week to get you one step closer to your goals? Have you thought about your goals during the pandemic? There is never a perfect time, there is only the moments you have now. Make them count. Let’s make it a great week! 

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

My Arizona Diary

So I moved to Arizona! Now this is a state that knows how to live!! Beautiful sunny days and warm balmy evenings. What a place! It is beautiful. We finally found our home. I love it here.

July 1st: Really heating up. Got to 100 today. Not a problem. Live in an air-conditioned home, drive an air-conditioned car. What a pleasure to see the sun every day like this. We’re turning into sun worshippers.

July 5th: Had the backyard landscaped with western plants today. Lots of cactus and rocks. What a breeze to maintain. No more mowing lawn for me. Another scorcher today, but we love it here.

July 9th: The temperature hasn’t been below 100 all week. How do people get used to this kind of heat? At least, it’s kind of windy though. But getting used to the heat is taking longer than we expected.

July 15th: I fell asleep by the community pool and got 3rd degree burns over 60% of my body. Missed 3 days of casino bus trips. What a dumb thing to do. I learned my lesson though. Got to respect the ol’ sun in a climate like this.

July 18th: We got a cat, named her Lomita…she snuck into the car when I left this morning. By the time I got to the hot car at noon, Lomita had died and swollen up to the size of a shopping bag, then popped like a water balloon. The car now smells like Tuna Kibbles and poop. I learned my lesson though. No more pets in this heat. Good ol’ Mr. Sun strikes again.

July 20th: The wind sucks. It feels like a giant freaking blow dryer!! And it’s hot as hell. The home air-conditioner is on the fritz and the AC repairman charged $500 just to drive by and tell me he needed to order parts.

July 22nd: We’ve been sleeping outside on the patio for 3 nights now. A multi-million-dollar resort, our new home and we can’t even go inside. Lomita is the lucky one. Why did I ever come here?

July 25th: It’s 115 degrees. Finally got the air-conditioner fixed today. It cost $1,500 and gets the temperature down to 85. I hate this stupid state.

July 27th: If another smart-ass cracks, “Hot enough for you today?” I’m going to strangle him. Damn heat. By the time we get to the grocery store, the radiator is boiling over, my clothes are soaking wet, and I smell like baked cat!!

July 28th: Tried to run some errands… I wore shorts, and when I sat on the seat in the car, I thought my butt was on fire. My skin melted to the seat. I lost 2 layers of flesh and all the hair on the back of my legs and ass. Now my car smells like burnt hair, fried ass, and baked cat.

July 29th: The weather report might as well be a dang recording. Hot and sunny. Hot and sunny. Hot and sunny. It’s been too hot to do anything for 2 months and the weatherman says it might really warm up next week. Doesn’t it ever rain in this damn desert? Water rationing will be next, so my $2,300 worth of cactus will just dry up and blow over. Even the cactus can’t live in this damn heat.

July 30th: Welcome to HELL! Temperature got to 120 today. Cacti are dead. Forgot to crack the window and blew the damn windshield out of the car. The installer came to fix it and said, “Hot enough for you today?” My wife paid $1,500 to bail me out of jail. Freakin’ Arizona! What kind of a sick demented idiot would want to live here??

Will write later to let you know how the trial goes…

Note: This has been a fictional, light-humor look at moving to Arizona. There was no cat; I like cats!

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,015

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…I hope this email finds you well and refreshed from a long holiday weekend! It was great to spend quality time with our family, and I hope that you found a safe and fun way to celebrate the freedoms our great country offers. This week, I want to talk about opportunities. In every dark cloud, there is a silver lining. In every challenge there is something to be learned. In every tragedy, there is something beautiful. I think you can agree that right now we are facing many interesting and unique challenges, however I’d like to encourage you to think outside the box. How can we turn these challenges into opportunities? What is the silver lining in your life? Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

The Parable of the Taoist Farmer

There was once a farmer in ancient China who owned a horse. “You are so lucky!” his neighbors told him, “to have a horse to pull the cart for you.” “Maybe,” the farmer replied.

One day he didn’t latch the gate properly and the horse ran away. “Oh no! That is terrible news!” his neighbors cried. “Such bad luck!” “Maybe,” the farmer replied.

A few days later the horse returned, bringing with it two wild horses. “How fantastic! You are so lucky,” his neighbors told him. “Maybe,” the farmer replied.

The following week the farmer’s son was breaking-in one of the wild horses when it threw him to the ground, breaking his leg. “Oh no!” the neighbors cried. “Such bad luck, all over again!” “Maybe,” the farmer replied.

The next day soldiers came and took away all the young men to fight in the army. The farmer’s son was left behind. “You are so lucky!” his neighbors cried. “Maybe,” the farmer replied.

When we interpret a situation as an ‘opportunity’ or a ‘disaster’ it shapes the way that we respond.

But the Taoist Farmer shows that we can never truly know how a situation is going to turn out. There are no intrinsic ‘opportunities’ or ‘threats’ — there is only what happens and how we choose to respond.

In which case, doesn’t it make sense to look for the opportunities in every situation?

        <description>

Interest rates are vital in real estate. Here’s why.

Interest rate fluctuations are always a necessary topic in real estate. In June, interest rates reached the low to mid-threes, but in June of last year, they were still up around 4.5%. This April, interest rates were the lowest they’ve been in 30 years at 3.5%. 

One of our lenders recently quoted rates as low as 2.5% on a 30-year fixed mortgage. For comparison, when I bought my first house about 40 years ago, I paid approximately an 11% interest rate. 

Let’s say a property costs $430,000 with a 3.5% interest rate; the payment would be $1,931 per month, not including taxes or insurance. Last year, with interest rates around 4.5%, the payment for that same property would be $2,179— $248 more per month than the lower interest rate, which is almost $3,000 more per year. Compared to a year ago, this gives buyers $50,000 more in buying power. Those are great savings for people buying today.

“Interest rates are currently around 3.5%; when I bought my first home around 40 years ago, I paid roughly 11%.”

Hopefully, this information was helpful, and you can sit down with your clients and either raise the price of their home or help them enter the marketplace with more knowledge. 

If you have questions about this or I can help you in any way, call or email me. I’d be happy to speak with you.

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…I hope this email finds you well and refreshed from the weekend. The summer temps are on the rise and that means summer is in full swing with Independence Day right around the corner. As we prepare to celebrate our great nation, I hope you will take a moment with your family and friends to remember what it means to be an American. Now more than ever, it is important to remember what makes our country the greatest in the world and what we had to do to get here and what it takes to protect our future. Our freedom wasn’t free, and we must never forget that. Happy Fourth of July! Let’s make it a great week! 

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

A Nation’s Strength by William Ralph Emerson

What makes a nation’s pillars highAnd its foundations strong?What makes it mighty to defyThe foes that round it throng?

It is not gold. Its kingdoms grandGo down in battle shock;Its shafts are laid on sinking sand,Not on abiding rock.

Is it the sword? Ask the red dustOf empires passed away;The blood has turned their stones to rust,Their glory to decay.

And is it pride? Ah, that bright crownHas seemed to nations sweet;But God has struck its luster downIn ashes at his feet.

Not gold but only men can makeA people great and strong;Men who for truth and honor’s sakeStand fast and suffer long.

Brave men who work while others sleep,Who dare while others fly…They build a nation’s pillars deepAnd lift them to the sky.

24 Thoughts Never to Forget

Your presence is a present to the world. You’re unique and one of a kind. Your life can be what you want it to be.

Take the days just one at a time. Count your blessings, not your troubles. You’ll make it through whatever comes along. Within you are so many answers. Understand, have courage, be strong.

Don’t put limits on yourself. So many dreams are waiting to be realized. Decisions are too important to leave to chance.

Reach for your peak, your goal, your prize. Nothing wastes more energy than worrying. The longer one carries a problem, the heavier it gets.

Don’t take things too seriously. Live a life of serenity, not a life of regrets. Remember that a little love goes a long way…Remember that a lot…goes forever. Remember that friendship is a wise investment.

Life’s treasures are people…together. Realize that it’s never too late. Do ordinary things in an extraordinary way. Have health and hope and happiness.

Take time to wish upon a star. And don’t ever forget…for even a day…How very special you are.

This is how we show homes during and after lockdown.

Lockdowns are easing, but the coronavirus is still making people sick, so how can you show listings during and post-lockdown? 

When the pandemic hit the U.S., we stepped up our marketing game. For higher-end homes, we hire professional photographers who take daylight, evening, and sunset photos. We wanted to give people the option of walking through a house without physically being there, and make them feel comfortable.

As an example of what we do, we had a seller contact us because they were canceling their listing with their previous real estate agent, as they weren’t providing good enough service. We got together in a Zoom call, and I gave them a complete listing presentation and showed them examples of our Matterport videos. We decided to price the property at $675,000 and luckily were able to host a physical open house because restrictions had been eased by then.

“In today’s market, we need to go the extra mile for our sellers.”

We took all precautions including masks, gloves, antiseptic wipes, and kept all doors open. We also did a lot of digital marketing for the open house. One of the buyers that came made a full-price offer, and now we’re in escrow. That home was on the market for less than a week. Today we also received a backup offer on the house. 

The right property, price, location, and marketing will get a home sold. In today’s market, we need to go the extra mile for our sellers. 

If there’s anything I can do to help you, including showing you how to use Zoom or showing you some of our marketing, I’d be glad to do so. I have 34 years of real estate experience, and my goal is to help other agents get better. 

If you have questions about marketing or anything else, call or email me. I’d be happy to speak with you.

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Today is My Day

Today my thoughts are centered on expecting only the best and giving only the best. Today my mind and heart are open to new opportunities and I make the most out of every situation.

Today I will smile and act enthusiastically in everything I do. I will make every person I meet feel very important and I will show them that I care. Today my confidence is high, and I am willing to step out and take a chance. I speak freely to all those I meet. I know I have something valuable to contribute. I expect results today and my time is well invested.

Today I am one step closer to achieving my goals and dreams. I always keep my eyes focused on success and prosperity. Today I will sow good seed so that I will reap my harvest of reward. 

Today is my day!

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,011

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…the events that have unfolded over the past few days have been heavy and complex, but I believe that something positive will come from all the unrest. I don’t want to use this platform to discuss the issues happening in our city and across the nation, however I do want to encourage each of you to listen, and use your voice to be a part of the change. Life is precious and I have been reminded that every time I hold my now week-old grandson. I am reminded that love is a powerful emotion and my tiny grandson has filled my heart with a love that I can’t explain. With that being said, to each of you reading this, I am sending you a little bit of that love in hopes that it will carry us through these uncertain times – and I hope that you will pass it on. Let’s make it a great week! 

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

It Is Up to Me

I woke up early today, excited over all I get to do before the clock strikes midnight.

I have responsibilities to fulfill today.

I am important. My job is to choose what kind of day I am going to have.

Today I can complain because the weather is rainy, or I can be thankful that the grass is getting watered for free.

Today I can feel sad that I don’t have more money, or I can be glad that my finances encourage me to plan my purchases wisely and guide me away from waste.

Today I can grumble about my health or I can rejoice that I am alive.

Today I can lament over all that my parents didn’t give me when I was growing up or I can feel grateful that they allowed me to be born.

Today I can cry because roses have thorns, or I can celebrate that thorns have roses.

Today I can mourn my lack of friends or I can excitedly embark upon a quest to discover new relationships.

Today I can whine because I have to go to work or I can shout for joy because I have a job to do.

Today I can complain because I have to go to school or eagerly open my mind and fill it with rich new tidbits of knowledge.

Today I can murmur dejectedly because I have to do housework, or I can feel honored because the Lord has provided shelter for my mind, body, and soul.

Today stretches ahead of me, waiting to be shaped, and I am the sculptor who gets to do the shaping.

*Today, my attitude is the difference. I get to choose what kind of day I will have! It is up to me. *

Here’s a breakdown of which industries were most affected by job losses due to coronavirus.

Last week, I discussed how the Raging River housing market will explode within the next month or two. Today, I’ll walk you through a breakdown of which industries were affected by 15% of the people who became unemployed in the last two months due to the coronavirus.

When you consider these numbers, bear in mind that while 15% is a lot of jobs lost, that still means 85% are gainfully employed:


  59.5% of this group were in the food service industry
  7.1% were in temporary help services
  6.6% were in retail
  6.1% were healthcare office workers
  4.1% were construction workers
  4.1% were also in the accommodation industry
  3.7% were child daycare workers


“Those who are unemployed due to COVID-19-related job losses will soon be able to rejoin the workforce.”

Just last week, it was announced that all surgical teams will be allowed to go back to work and focus on elective surgeries once more.

The bottom line: Those who are unemployed due to COVID-19-related job losses will soon be able to rejoin the workforce, and I think once they do, our market will repair itself quickly.

If you have any questions about the Phoenix market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,009

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…did you know that each Memorial Day a moment of remembrance takes place at 3pm local time? It is unclear where the tradition originated but what a great way to truly remember those who sacrificed their lives for our freedoms. I have a tremendous amount of respect for all our armed forces, for their dedication and commitment to our great country. I know this Memorial Day may not look like past celebrations with family and friends, but I hope you will take a moment at 3pm today to honor the fallen men and women who represent the great USA. Let’s make it a great week!  

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

We Honor You Today © Susan R. Smith

To all of our veteransFar and near.We thank you for your serviceFor all those years.

You sacrificed your time,And some gave your life.You preserved our freedomBy willingly paying the price.

Many of youWere sent overseas.You were wounded in battleWith scars and disease.But courageous and brave,You weathered the storm.

You faced every battleWith faith and beyond.We honor you with joyFor all that you’ve done.You stood strong for our country,For our daughters and sons.

So no one stands alone,We walk hand in hand.Remember, we are with you.Together we shall stand.We salute you today.

Hear what we say.Let our words speak eloquentlyIn this special way.On this day,Let us express our love and thanksFor the sacrifice you paid.You served in honorFor many years and days,And we will never forgetHow you were strong and brave.

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Beginning Today, Author Unknown

Beginning today I will no longer worry about yesterday.It is in the past and the past will never change.Only I can change by choosing to do so.

Beginning today I will no longer worry about tomorrow.Tomorrow will always be there, waiting for me to make the most of it.But I cannot make the most of tomorrow without firstmaking the most of today.

Beginning today I will look in the mirror and I will see a person worthy of my respect and admiration.This capable person looking back at me is someone I enjoy spending timewith and someone I would like to get to know better.

Beginning today I will cherish each moment of my life.I value this gift bestowed upon me in this world and I will unselfishlyshare this gift with others.I will use this gift to enhance the lives of others.

Beginning today I will take a moment to step off the beaten path and torevel in the mysteries I encounter.I will face challenges with courage and determination.I will overcome what barriers there may be which hinder my quest for growth and self-improvement.

Beginning today I will take life one day at a time, one step at a time.Discouragement will not be allowed to taint my positive self-image,my desire to succeed or my capacity to love.

Beginning today I walk with renewed faith in human kindness.Regardless of what has gone before, I believe there is hopefor a brighter and better future.

Beginning today I will open my mind and my heart.I will welcome new experiences. I will meet new people.I will not expect perfection from myself nor anyone else: perfection does not exist in an imperfect world.But I will applaud the attempt to overcome human foibles.

Beginning today I am responsible for my own happiness and I will do things that make me happy . . .admire the beautiful wonders of nature, listen to my favorite music,pet a kitten or a puppy, soak in a bubble bath . . .pleasure can be found in the most simple of gestures.

Beginning today I will learn something new; I will try something different; I will savor all the various flavors life has to offer.I will change what I can and the rest I will let go.I will strive to become the best me I can possibly be.

Beginning today. And every day.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.” – Steve Jobs

“One isn’t necessarily born with courage, but one is born with potential. Without courage, we cannot practice any other virtue with consistency. We can’t be kind, true, merciful, generous, or honest.” –Maya Angelou

“Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.” – Dale Carnegie

        <description>

Our market is a river, and we have no choice but to go with the flow.

I often like to look at the real estate market as a flowing river. There will always be a current, but sometimes that current is moving slowly like a stream and other times it’s roaring quickly. 

Coming into January, February, and mid-March, the market was absolutely on fire, with most homes under $350,000 generating multiple offers. Inventory was coming off of the market almost as quickly as it was coming on, and 2020 was primed to be a stellar year. 

When stay-at-home orders were issued throughout the states and the reality of life under quarantine settled in, we saw skeptical buyers canceling their purchase and sellers canceling their listings for fear of having exposed individuals walk through their homes. Basically, the current of the market slowed dramatically. When the current drops, it exposes boulders in the middle of the river, causing more rapids; navigating the market in March was treacherous, and everybody was stressed out.

“The dam that might have been created by COVID-19 two months ago is now going to release all of the pent-up demand back into the market.”

What we’ve noticed, however, is that as inventory levels have come up, the metaphorical water level also rises, which in turn reduces the number of rapids in the market. That’s why April was a pretty strong market, and things are continuing to look healthier. 

Though the official dates keep changing, our city is expected to start a multiphase reopening soon. The dam that might have been created by COVID-19 two months ago is now going to release all of the pent-up demand back into the market. That means the river will be raging these next few quarters, and, assuming we can finally put this pandemic behind us, we’ll be preparing for a busy season that extends all the way into December. 

If you have any questions about what was discussed in this message, or if you’re interested in buying or selling a home soon but aren’t sure how to proceed in these times, reach out to us. We’re always here to help, and we look forward to hearing from you.

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…I hope that each of you found a unique and creative way to celebrate the special moms in your life. I am so grateful for my own mother, Tonya, my daughter Brandi and my future daughter-in-law Ashely for everything they represent for our family. Every Mother’s Day I am reminded that we should be celebrating these amazing women in our lives more often, and during these uncertain times it is amazing to witness the strength and resilience of these women who are now teachers, caregivers and so much more.

Time - We all have 24 hours!

Are you usually punctual or late? Do you finish things within the time you stipulate? Do you hand in your reports/work on time? Are you able to accomplish what you want to do before deadlines? Are you a good time manager?

If your answer is “no” to any of the questions above, that means you’re not managing your time as well as you want. Here are 20 tips on how to be a better time manager:

Create a daily plan.Peg a time limit to each task.Use a calendar.Use an organizer.Know your deadlines.Learn to say “No.”Target to be early.Time box your activities.Have a clock visibly placed before you.Set reminders 15 minutes before.Focus.Block out distractions.Track your time spent.Don’t fuss about unimportant details.Prioritize.Delegate.Batch similar tasks together.Eliminate your time wasters.Cut off when you need to.Leave buffer time in-between.

As we head into May, our real estate market is starting to pick back up. Here are the latest numbers.

The April numbers are in for our real estate market, so we’re taking a look at them today. Compared to last year, listings are down 21%, pending sales are down 22%, and listings under contract are down 23.7%.

The pandemic has slowed down the activity in our market, but things have been starting to pick back up in the last few weeks. Our closings per month that sold over listing price in April was at an all-time high. To learn more about what’s going on, watch this short video.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,006

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…I hope this email finds you in good spirits and embracing the summer temperatures because they are here to stay. Did you have the opportunity to enjoy the community fly-over curiosity of our fearless airmen at Luke Airforce? It was a sight to see, and good reminder how blessed we are to be Americans, despite the challenging times we are in. Today I want to give a big shout out to all the frontline workers in our community who are tirelessly working to take care of our residents – we appreciate you and your commitment to the health and wellbeing of our community! If you happen to encounter a frontline worker this week (or you personally know someone) please give them an extra special THANK YOU! Let’s make it a great week! 

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Action: Do you want to make massive positive change in your life? Take Action. You can sit there are wish or you can get up and take action. Action is what will make your life different.

Persistence: You need the ability to hang on during tough times. Do not give up when you feel that you are doing the right thing. Too many people stopped 3 feet from gold. Be one of the few who doesn’t.

Learning: What you know today needs to change tomorrow. You must constantly learn new things and then apply them. Do not always learn the hard way - make it your decision.

Effort: In all things that you do out forth your best effort. There are very few separators in this world and EFFORT is one of the most important.

Caring: Remember that being successful alone will leave you on top of a mountain lonely. Care about people around you and help lift up anyone you can. That is where true success will come from.

Plan: To make great strides you need to know where you wish to go. Plan what you want and how you will get or do it. Make sure to adjust the plan when you get new information and put the effort in to succeed.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“My hope still is to leave the world a bit better than when I got here.” - Jim Henson

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…the summer temps have arrived in the Valley of the Sun, and I hope this email finds you navigating the pandemic with a little more grace and understanding than last week. I am sure you, just like my family are looking forward to the weeks that lie ahead when we can begin to return to some normality. The Phoenix real estate market is still moving, with more than 14,000 active homes on the market and nearly 9,800 homes went under contract!

We are resilient, strong and innovative which creates unique and different opportunities to learn, grow and become better humans, and a better community. I believe there are opportunities everywhere we look if we are open and willing to see. What opportunities are in your life? Let’s make it a great week! 

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

One day a farmer found an eagle’s egg and brought it home. He placed the eagle’s egg together with some chicken eggs to be hatched. The little eagle was hatched together with the other chicks. He began his life like the other chicks and the mother hen. He followed the ways of the chicken. He ate, walked, crowed, and moved like all the other chickens. One day an eagle flying nearby saw the little eagle mingling together with the chickens. He flew down to talk to the young eagle. All the chickens ran away because they were terrified of the eagle. The young eagle also tried to run but was stopped by the adult eagle. The adult eagle asked, “What are you doing here with the chickens? You are an eagle just like me. You can fly like me and your home is high up among the cliffs”. The young eagle said, “I am a chicken, and this is where I belong, together with the other chickens. See, I cannot fly!” The adult eagle then grabbed the eagle in his claws, and with all his might proceeded to fly to the nearby cliffs. The adult eagle said, “I am going to teach you how to fly.” The flying lesson began and to his bewilderment, the young eagle discovered that he could fly. Of course, he fell many times before succeeding. He discovered his true self with the help of the adult eagle, and never again went back to the chickens. We are all born eagles and are able to soar high into the heavens. We are not chickens that stay on the ground looking for food, just for the day. We have a higher potential within us, and we should realize it. In fact, we should be successful like the adult eagle, so that we can in turn teach other young eagles, who think they are chickens to fly.

“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.” – Thomas Edison

“When written in Chinese, the word ‘crisis’ is composed of two characters. One represents danger and the other represents opportunity.” – John F. Kennedy

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,004

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…last week I sent you twenty-five ways to develop a growth mindset. Did you like those ideas? I loved them! And in our uncertain world today, keeping a growth mindset is key to how we successful navigate the world around us. No matter what is happening in our life, across the nation or globe, we all have a choice each day. We can choose to see the world as doom and gloom, or we can choose to find the silver lining. We get to decided how we are going to perceive our experiences and what actions we will take. I hope you will choose wisely.

Before you read on, I’d like to ask again this week: How are you doing? How is your family and loved one? Is there anything we can do to help you today? We are here for you. Let’s make it a great week!

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…the other day someone sent me a link to an article that I am going to share below, so I’ll keep this part of my message short. But before you read on, I’d like to ask: How are you doing? How is your family and loved one? Is there anything we can do to help you today? We are here for you, so please reach out. Let’s make it a great week! 

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

25 Simple Ways to Develop A Growth Mindset

1. Acknowledge and embrace imperfections: Hiding from your weaknesses means you’ll never overcome them.

2. View challenges as opportunities: Having a growth mindset means relishing opportunities for self-improvement.

3. Try different learning tactics: There’s no one-size-fits-all model for learning. What works for one person may not work for you.

4. Follow the research on brain plasticity: The brain isn’t fixed; the mind shouldn’t be either.

5. Replace the word “failing” with the word “learning.” When you make a mistake or fall short of a goal, you haven’t failed; you’ve learned.

6. Stop seeking approval: When you prioritize approval over learning, you sacrifice your own potential for growth.

7. Value the process over the end result: Intelligent people enjoy the learning process, and don’t mind when it continues beyond an expected time frame.

8. Cultivate a sense of purpose: Research also showed that students with a growth mindset had a greater sense of purpose. Keep the big picture in mind.

9. Celebrate growth with others: If you truly appreciate growth, you’ll want to share your progress with others.

10. Emphasize growth over speed: Learning fast isn’t the same as learning well and learning well sometimes requires allowing time for mistakes.

11. Reward actions, not traits: Tell students when they’re doing something smart, not just being smart.

12. Redefine “genius.” The myth’s been busted: genius requires hard work, not talent alone.

13. Portray criticism as positive: You don’t have to use that hackneyed term, “constructive criticism,” but you do have to believe in the concept.

14. Disassociate improvement from failure: Stop assuming that “room for improvement” translates into failure.

15. Provide regular opportunities for reflection: Reflect on what you’ve learned at least once a day.

16. Place effort before talent: Hard work should always be rewarded before inherent skill.

17. Highlight the relationship between learning and “brain training.” The brain is like a muscle that needs to be worked out, just like the body.

18. Cultivate grit: People with that extra bit of determination will be more likely to seek approval from themselves rather than others.

19. Abandon the image: “Naturally smart” sounds just about as believable as “spontaneous generation.” You won’t achieve the image if you’re not ready for the work.

20. Use the word “yet.” Whenever you are struggling with a task, tell yourself that you haven’t mastered it yet.

21. Learn from other people’s mistakes: It’s not always wise to compare yourself to others, but it is important to realize that humans share the same weaknesses.

22. Make a new goal for every goal accomplished: You’ll never be done learning. Just because your midterm exam is over doesn’t mean you should stop being interested in a subject. Growth-minded people know how to constantly create new goals to keep themselves stimulated.

23. Take risks in the company of others: Stop trying to save face all the time and just let yourself goof up now and then. It will make it easier to take risks in the future.

24. Think realistically about time and effort: It takes time to learn. Don’t expect to master every topic under the sun in one sitting.

25. Take ownership over your attitude: Once you develop a growth mindset, own it. Acknowledge yourself as someone who possesses a growth mentality and be proud to let it guide you throughout your educational career.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,002

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…as we prepare ourselves for another week of sheltering in place, let’s keep in mind that how we choose to spend our time is completely up to us, and many of us have a few extra hours in the day which we are not used to having available. Despite the uncertainty, we can still choose to be in a positive mood, or we can choose not to. We can still choose to focus on the things in our lives that we have control over, or we can choose not to. There are very few things we truly have control over, but what you do have control over is your attitude and your actions. The beauty about life, is that it’s all up to us. My offer still stands that any of you reading this who might need help getting essentials, please give me a call directly. We will get through this as a community – and come back even stronger as a nation! Let’s make it a great week!  

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

We shall do much in the years to come,But what have we done today?

We shall give out gold in a princely sum,But what did we give today?

We shall lift the heart and dry the tear,We shall plant a hope in the place of fear,

We shall speak the words of love and cheer,But what did we speak today?

We shall be so kind in the after while,But what have we done today?

We shall bring to each lonely life a smile,But what have we brought today?

We shall give to truth a grander birth,And to steadfast faith a deeper worth,

We shall feed the hungering souls of earth,But whom have we fed today?

We shall reap such joys in the by and by,But what have we sown today?

We shall build us mansions in the sky,But what have we built today? 

`Tis sweet in the idle dreams to bask;But here and now, do we our task?

Yet, this is the thing our souls must ask,What have we done today?

By: Nixon Waterman

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,001

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…I hope that this email finds you and your family well and navigating our new normal the best you can. It has been a week full of ever-changing news, challenges and continued uncertainty, however today’s I’d like to share some ideas and thoughts on what we can focus on to be the light in our communities.


  Stick to a routine: if you are working from home, get up and get dressed as if you were going into the office – don’t lay around all day in your pajamas.
  Practice good mental and physical health: now is the time to use your new Peloton or check out the variety of “free” apps offering services such as Down Dog Apps which has options for yoga beginners, HIIT, Barre and 7 minute workouts – all for free until May 1st. Audible is currently offering hundreds of books on audio – all for free.
  Master virtual technology: we hosted our first “virtual” happy hour last week and it was a fantastic way to connect with our agents while we are practicing social distancing – we got to know each other in a difference space.  Zoom Chat Room is an amazing tool to help you continue to connect both professionally or personally online.
  Focus on the positive: Interest rates are low, and in Arizona real estate is considered an essential service. Since March 1st, there have been nearly 5,000 homes listed for sale in Maricopa County and just over 9,000 homes sale pending. In every dark time, there is always a silver lining. Look for the opportunities instead of focusing on fear.
  Get back to the basics: I don’t care what industry you are in, times like this remind us to get back to the basics. Reach out to people you know, review your budget and expenses, update your systems and processes – get your “house” in order so you are ready for the “bounce” back.


If you or anyone you know is struggling right now, I would like to extend a personal invitation to call me directly. We are in this together, as a community and as humanity. Stay safe and healthy, and let’s try to remember, this too shall pass!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Ideas for you and your family while practicing social distancing:


  Play your favorite board games
  Make a movie with your family as the cast
  Build a fort in your living room
  Camp out in your backyard
  Make video calls to family and friends
  Get a little fresh air with a walk around the block
  Do an indoor scavenger hunt with items around your home


WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Faith is to believe what you do not see; the reward of this faith is to see what you believe.” - Saint Augustine

“People who have good relationships at home are more effective in the marketplace.” - Zig Ziglar

“To keep the body in good health is a duty… otherwise we shall not be able to keep our mind strong and clear.” - Buddha

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 1,000

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…what a wild ride it has been with the continued spread of the Covid19 outbreak! At RE/MAX Professionals, we took swift action including sending our employees home and implementing safety measures for all our clients who currently have their homes on the market or those who are actively looking to purchase. The question I have been asked the most over the last week…how’s the market?

Despite the pandemic, RE/MAX Professionals was able to successfully close thirty-eight transactions, negotiated contracts on thirty-six homes and listed for sale another twenty-two homes. Our company and our agents are working hard and ready to help you and your loved ones safely navigate these uncertain, unprecedented times. We are here to help, however we can.

If you or someone you know is struggling to find essential supplies or in need of help getting medications, etc. please reach out to me directly. We are all in this together! Stay safe and healthy, and let’s try to remember, this too shall pass.  

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

One evening I was going back from a supermarket. As I have approached my car, I noticed that some person came and stood beside me. He was the one that could be considered as a bum. It seemed that he had no car, no home and no job. I expected that he will ask me for money, but he did not do that, he only said: “Your car is very nice.”

After several moments of silence, I have replied: “Thanks” and then the inner voice told me: “Ask him if he needs help.” After a short hesitation I have asked him, if he needs any help. His respond was astonishing, I will never forget those simple three words that I heard from him: “Don‘t we all?”

It was a true discovery to me. I needed help. Although I had money and a place to sleep, but I recognized that I needed help too. Then I have opened my wallet and gave him enough money to get a meal and some shelter for a day.

Suddenly I understood that no matter how much money, achievements, luxury things do we have, we all need help. And on the other hand, no matter how poor you are, how many material problems you have, you still might offer your help to others, you still might be giving. Even it‘s just a nice word, you can give that and it can be priceless to other person.

Maybe that man was just a homeless stranger, but to me he was more than that. Maybe he was sent by the Highest Loving Power personally to me, to open my eyes, to show me that there is one thing, among all other values and achievements, which is very important and irreplaceable for each and every person. Actually, it is a true gift and it is called giving.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Kindness is the language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see.” – Mark Twain

“Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul - and sings the tunes without the words - and never stops at all.” – Emily Dickinson

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 999

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…in just a few short days, the world as we know it has forever been changed by the outbreak of Coronavirus. However, in every dark moment, there is light and as community its important that we try to calm the panic, find compassion and patience as we navigate this new “normal.”

As this last week unfolded, I was reminded how important it is to slow down, smile at a stranger (they need it), have a sense of humor (you need it) and don’t forget your manners by saying please and thank you. In one of my favorite books, The Greatest Salesman in the World written by Og Mandino he writes that “this too shall pass” and while things are uncertain today, this too shall pass – and perhaps something good will come of it. For now, I am going to stay positive, smile and choose to be the best person I can be. I’d like to encourage you to do the same. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

24 Thoughts Never to Forget…

Your presence is a present to the world. You’re unique and one of a kind. Your life can be what you want it to be.

Take the days just one at a time. Count your blessings, not your troubles. You’ll make it through whatever comes along. Within you are so many answers. Understand, have courage, be strong.

Don’t put limits on yourself. So many dreams are waiting to be realized. Decisions are too important to leave to chance.

Reach for your peak, your goal, your prize. Nothing wastes more energy than worrying. The longer one carries a problem, the heavier it gets.

Don’t take things too seriously. Live a life of serenity, not a life of regrets. Remember that a little love goes a long way…Remember that a lot…goes forever. Remember that friendship is a wise investment.

Life’s treasures are people…together. Realize that it’s never too late. Do ordinary things in an extraordinary way. Have health and hope and happiness.

Take time to wish upon a star. And don’t ever forget…for even a day…How very special you are. 

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“I love the man that can smile in trouble, that can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. ‘Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but he whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves his conduct, will pursue his principles unto death.” - Thomas Paine

“It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.” – Aristotle

“Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.” - Steve Jobs

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 998

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…this week, let’s spend some time thinking about what it means to be truly happy. What is it that gets you excited? What is it that makes you want to do more of it? What is it that makes you happy? These are the things that you need to do more of! Being efficient, productive, and organized is only worthwhile if you fill the remaining time with things that make you feel excited and happy. This doesn’t mean you need to completely turn your life upside down; just start by adding a little more happiness here and there. You can do it! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Believing in You, By Catherine Pulsifer

Never stop believing in yourself. When others doubt, don’t you. 

Do what you love to do, No one knows better than you.

Life is too short to live others’ dreams. Follow your own dream. 

Push yourself to reach your goals, And live the life you once dreamed.

Trust your instincts. Be true to yourself. 

You know what is right for you. Never give up or give in.

Forget the words “I don’t know how.” You can learn, you can research, you can do.

Your mind is powerful. When you believe you can. 

You will find a way, You won’t waste a day.

Persist and persevere. Do not fear,Because if you believe in you.

You will find dreams can come true.May all your dreams turn into goals, believe in yourself. 

And remember, all of life is a choice. The decision is up to you.

Believe in yourself, Dare to be whatever you want to be!

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“True happiness… is not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a worthy purpose.” – Helen Keller

“Some cause happiness wherever they go; others whenever they go.” – Oscar Wilde

“It is not in the pursuit of happiness that we find fulfillment, it is in the happiness of pursuit.” - Denis Waitley

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 997

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…last week I was in Las Vegas attending the annual RE/MAX convention and I can’t tell you how proud I am to be surrounded by such amazing people that work for our company. I was inspired and motivated by each and every one of them over the four days we spent together at R4. Which brings me to this week’s topic.

What do you think is more important…succeeding or getting started? The massively successful people in the world don’t worry about succeeding nearly as much as they do about getting started. In reality, you can’t have one before the other! The key to succeeding at anything in life is taking the first step, even if you don’t know all the answers. This week I’d like to challenge you to let go of the fear of failure and take action towards the life you dream of. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

When the Sun Comes Up!

In Africa every morning a gazelle wakes up knowing that it must outrun the fastest lion if it wants to stay alive.

Every morning a lion wakes up knowing that it must run father than the slowest gazelle or it will starve to death.

It makes no difference whether you are a lion or a gazelle – when the sun comes up, you had better be running.

I’d just prefer to be a lion!

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Take the first step in faith. You don’t have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step.” – Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

“Ability is what you’re capable of doing. Motivation determines what you do. Attitude determines how well you do it.” – Lou Holtz

“A real decision is measured by the fact that you’ve taken a new action. If there’s no action, you haven’t truly decided.” – Tony Robbins

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 996

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…this week I’d like to remind you the value of a team. There is not one person on this earth who can do everything themselves. When we associate ourselves with people that have the same mindset, goals, dreams, and determination we all become collectively stronger.

Look around you this week and decide if you are doing everything you can to make the people around you better. Are they doing the same for you? Life is more than a two-way street. There are twists and turns, bumps and potholes, red lights and even stop signs. Are you surrounded by people that will help you every step of the way? Are you prepared to do your part in return? Let’s embrace the help of others, while giving more than we get! Let’s make it a great week!

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 995

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…as we continue to evolve in our personal and professional development, let’s keep in mind that the world is full of mirrors. We will see in ourselves what we put out to the world and we will get back what we give to others. As you wake each morning, I hope you look forward to all the great opportunity you have each day. As you wake each morning, I hope you look forward to all the people you will have the chance to meet or help that day. As you wake each morning, I hope you look forward to all the love, happiness, and joy you could have if you just gave it. This week spend a few more minutes on what you have total control over - your attitude towards others. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

House Of 1000 Mirrors, Author Unknown

Long ago in a small, far away village, there was place known as the House of 1000 Mirrors. A small, happy little dog learned of this place and decided to visit. When he arrived, he bounced happily up the stairs to the doorway of the house. He looked through the doorway with his ears lifted high and his tail wagging as fast as it could. To his great surprise, he found himself staring at 1000 other happy little dogs with their tails wagging just as fast as his. He smiled a great smile, and was answered with 1000 great smiles just as warm and friendly. As he left the House, he thought to himself, “This is a wonderful place. I will come back and visit it often.” 

In this same village, another little dog, who was not quite as happy as the first one, decided to visit the house. He slowly climbed the stairs and hung his head low as he looked into the door. When he saw the 1000 unfriendly looking dogs staring back at him, he growled at them and was horrified to see 1000 little dogs growling back at him. As he left, he thought to himself, “That is a horrible place, and I will never go back there again.” 

All the faces in the world are mirrors. What kind of reflections do you see in the faces of the people you meet?

        <description>

Today I’m explaining how lessons from former NBA player Mark Eaton’s amazing book apply to real estate agents.

At a conference in Orlando last week, I had the pleasure of listening to speaker Mark Eaton, author of “The Four Commitments of a Winning Team.” Many may be familiar with Eaton, who stands seven feet, four inches tall, from his professional basketball career with the Utah Jazz. 

His book is an absolute page-turner that recounts his personal story. He was a mechanic who didn’t play basketball in high school and never went to college. A coach who encountered Eaton at the auto shop tried to talk him into becoming a member of a junior college basketball team. 

Eaton had zero interest in basketball and shooed the coach away. However, as Eaton recalls, the coach was incredibly persistent; he approached Eaton 15 more times! Ultimately, he convinced this mechanic with no basketball experience to come attend workouts and devote just an hour of his daily time to the junior college team.

Eaton joined the team and had success on the court. He went on to play for UCLA, where he didn’t enjoy nearly as much success. Nevertheless, coaches sent out some highlight reels to the worst team in the NBA at that time, the Utah Jazz, and they drafted Eaton in the fourth round. 

As fans of the league know, Eaton went on to become one of the best defensive players to ever play the sport, racking up a record 14 blocks in one game and setting a record for single-season blocks (456) that has yet to be broken.

“If you protect clients, they’ll remember what you did for them.”

How did this transformation happen? It started with someone believing in him. Together, they started by working on the basics of the sport—how to dribble, how to block and get in the lane, and how to rebound. 

So here are Eaton’s four commitments as applied to the real estate industry: 


Know your job. Study scripts, do your roleplays, etc. Day in and day out, do whatever you must to master the craft.&nbsp;

Do as you’re asked. There’s a lot of noise from supposed gurus telling you how to excel in this industry, but focus only on what clients are asking you to do for them.&nbsp;

Make people around you look good. Be positive. If you’re cross-selling with someone, don’t drag them down or be dragged down to their level. Don’t blame anybody, either.&nbsp;

Protect others. Our license requires us to look out for people’s best interests. If you protect clients, they’ll remember what you did for them and tell others about you.&nbsp;


If you have any questions about the topic covered in today’s message, feel free to call or email me. I would love to speak with you.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 994

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…this week I wanted to talk about happiness. Many of us do not spend that much time thinking about our own happiness. We go about our day just looking to do whatever we can to get to the next day. When we do think about happiness it is mostly about how we can make the people around us happier. I would suggest to you that true happiness is contagious. If you are happy with who you are, the things you are doing, and the way you are doing them, you will certainly be in a better place to make others happy.

This week let’s take some time to focus on happiness and how to create more of it in your life. When you are happier, the people around you will be too. When you are happier, your situation looks better. When you are happier, great things happen. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Wishing 

Do you wish the World were better? Let me tell you what to do: 

Set a watch upon your actions, Keep them always straight and true. Rid your mind of selfish motives, Let your thoughts be clean and high. You can make a little Eden Of the sphere you occupy. 

Do you wish the World were wiser? Then suppose you make a start, 

By accumulating wisdom In the scrap book of your heart. Do not waste one page on folly; Live to learn and learn to live. If you want to give men knowledge You must get it ere you give. 

Do you wish the World were happy? Then remember day by day, 

Just to scatter seeds of kindness, As you pass along the way. For the pleasures of the many, May be oft times traced to one. As the hand that plants an acorn, Shelters armies from the sun. 

Poet: Ella Wheeler Wilcox

“Most folks are as happy as they make up their minds to be.” - Abraham Lincoln

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 993

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…let’s take the bull by the horns this week! Are there things in your life that you consistently put off? Are there things in your business that you know you should do, but you keep telling yourself you can do them later? Well, this is the week to get some of those things done and checked off your list!

You will feel a great sense of satisfaction when you take something that has been on your mind for a long time and get it done. Maybe it’s calling a family member you have not spoken to in a while. Maybe it’s calling those clients that you have not been in touch with recently to see how they are doing. Maybe it’s organizing your desk or files. Maybe it’s helping a friend with something they need to do. Whatever it is that comes to your mind – let’s get it done this week. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

A woman was waiting at an airport for her hours long flight. Since her flight was delayed, she had several hours on her hand. So, she went to airport shops and bought a book and bag of cookies. She took a seat next to a man and started to read the book she had bought. While she was engrossed in her book, she happened to see, that the man sitting beside her boldly grabbed a cookie from the cookie bag. She ignored the incident to avoid a scene.

She munched some cookies from the bag and went back to her book. But the man seemed to have enjoyed the cookies way too much, he took some more cookies from the bag and started munching it.By the passing time she was getting more and more irritated as the cookie thief finished her cookie stock. Every time she took a cookie from the bag, he took one. When the last cookie was left, the man nervously took that cookie and broke it in half. He offered the other half to the lady and smiled. The lady snatched the other half of the cookie from his and thought, “This guy has some nerve that even after eating a half bag of my cookies, he didn’t show any gratitude.”

She had been so galled by the man and was relieved when her flight was called. She gathered her belongings and headed to the gate, refusing to look back at the thieving ingrate. She boarded the plane and sat in her seat reading her book. She reached her hand in her baggage, she was surprised to find a bag full of cookies in it.

If my cookies are here, she moaned in despair, the other one which she was eating from were his, and he tried to share. While she was flushed with anger about her cookies the man was happily sharing his cookie with her. She was filled with the feeling of guilt and regret. But It was too late to apologize.

Moral: Things are not always as they appear.

“All human actions have one or more of these seven causes: chance, nature, compulsions, habit, reason, passion, desire.” – Aristotle

        <description>

I have a story to share with you that demonstrates what it takes to be a successful REALTOR&reg;.

What does it take to be a successful REALTOR®?

To answer that question, I’ll share a quick story I posted on Facebook a couple of days ago. If you’re new to real estate, this story is especially important. Most of us are diligent about posting our successes online (e.g., “We sold a house in three days for full price with multiple offers!”) The downside to this is that the consumer thinks our job is easy. 

The story starts when I was referred a client from an out-of-town RE/MAX agent. The client was the agent’s brother, and he was relocating to the Phoenix area due to a job transfer. He was a high Type D personality type—the kind of person who wants everything done immediately. I got the referral a couple of days before Christmas, but he needed to be in a house by January 6. It was a busy time in my household. Along with Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year’s Eve, and New Year’s Day, I was celebrating my 60th birthday on Christmas. Furthermore, this buyer had three kids (one of which was a special-needs child) and four large dogs, so he needed a one-acre property on the west side of town. 

We had a challenge on our hands. We found a home, but we couldn’t negotiate the proper close of escrow so we had to back out. Once we found another home, we got the offer accepted and negotiated the contracts on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The day after, however, we performed the inspection and found some issues. All the while, the seller’s agent wasn’t very helpful, and she actually told me she didn’t care whether the home sold or not.

“Inventory is historically low, and as the year goes on, buyer demand will be high.”

That’s when we started looking for a backup property, and we found one, but we still made another counteroffer to the previous seller and their agent to make the situation right. They didn’t, so we canceled that contract and moved on to the third house. Fortunately, this seller’s agent was great and expedited everything for us. On the 6th, we were able to hand over the keys to the house to my buyer. 

We got the deal done, but it took a lot of time and teamwork. That’s what it takes in today’s market to represent a client, especially one who’s relocating. Inventory is historically low, and as the year goes on, buyer demand will be high. 

We’re in a service industry, so remember to go the extra mile to make sure your clients are happy. 

If you’d like to talk more about what it takes to be a successful REALTOR® or have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 992

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! It was a somber ending to the weekend as the world learned the tragic news of the helicopter crash that took NBA Basketball Player, Kobe Bryant and his beautiful daughter Gianna. My son was only six years old when Kobe joined the basketball league and he was Nate Jr.’s favorite player, so much that the number eight was his number in the sports he played and when that wasn’t available it was the number twenty-four.

Whether you were a fan or not, Kobe left a mark on the basketball world, the community he served, his family and so many others. This tragedy is a reminder that life is precious, and we just never know when it might end. Let it be a reminder that each day is a gift. Let it be a reminder that we have so much potential and so much to give the world if we let our light shine. Let it be a reminder to live life on your terms. Sending each of you much love and peace. Hug your families, share your kindness and compassion for those around you. Let’s make it a great week! #RIPMamba

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

I will tell you a story of my friend Monty Roberts.

As he was a kid, his father as a horse trainer was moving from stable to stable, from ranch to ranch, training horses. Thus, the boy‘s school career was constantly interrupted. One day, when he was a senior, teacher asked him to write about what he wanted to be when he grew up. He did not hesitate a minute and wrote seven-page paper about his aim to be an owner of a horse ranch, he wrote many details and drew a location of buildings and stables and even a detailed house plan.

Two days later he received his paper back with letter “F” on the front page. After class he came to teacher and asked: “Why did I receive an F?” The teacher responded: “This dreams is so unrealistic for a boy like you, who has no money, no resources and who comes from itinerant family. There is no possibility that you will reach your great goals one day.”  Then the teacher offered to rewrite the paper with more realistic attitude.

The boy went home and asked his father, how he should act. The father answered: “This decision is very important for you. So you have to make your own mind on this.”

After several days the boy brought the same paper to his teacher. No changes were made. He said: “Keep the F and I will keep my dream.”

Now Monty Roberts owns 4,000-square-foot house in the middle of 200-acre horse ranch and he still has that school paper, which now is framed over the fireplace.

Remember, you have to follow your heart, never give up, move on with determination and persistence, and never let anyone take your dreams away.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“I don’t want to be the next Michael Jordan, I only want to be Kobe Bryant.” – Kobe Bryant

“I have self-doubt. I have insecurity. I have fear of failure. I have nights when I show up at the arena and I’m like, ‘My back hurts, my feet hurt, my knees hurt. I don’t have it. I just want to chill.’ We all have self-doubt. You don’t deny it, but you also don’t capitulate to it. You embrace it.” - Kobe Bryant

“Winning takes precedence over all. There’s no gray area. No almosts.” - Kobe Bryant

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 991

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! I trust that this email has found you well-rested from the weekend and perhaps enjoying an extra day off as we honor history and the man who fought for change, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The world is full of visionaries and changers of history and as a community, a country, a great big world, we need those individuals who are brave enough to face adversity for the betterment of the collective whole. Standing up for what you believe in, it’s always easy and today, we should let the legacy of Dr. King be a reminder – to never give up on a dream.  Let’s make it a great week!

 

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Where we place our focus, the rest of our mind and emotions will follow. So how do we learn how to do this focus stuff? One of the quickest ways to begin to strengthen your focus muscles is to practice the 5%/95% rule. That means to focus no more than 5% on what you don’t want and 95% on what you do want.

Focus 5% on what you fear 95 % on getting educated and skilled to face it.

Focus 5% on the problem 95% on the healthiest solution.

Focus 5% on the mistake 95 % on learning from it.

Focus 5% on who to blame 95% on making sure to heal.

Focus 5% on what you must do 95% on enjoying the process of it.

Focus 5% on the conflict 95% on the win-win-win resolution.

Focus 5% on what you can’t control 95% on what you do have control over.

Focus 5% on what others say 95% on what you believe.

Focus 5% on what you have 95% on what you want to have.

Focus 5% on reading this 95% on applying it.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” – Martin Luther King, Jr.

“Faith is taking the first step even when you don’t see the whole staircase.” – Martin Luther King, Jr.

“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” – Martin Luther King, Jr.

“The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.” – Martin Luther King, Jr.

        <description>

I’m sharing why your average commission may have risen by $2,000 in the last five years.

I have exceptional news for you: Did you know that over the last five years your average commission per transaction increased by $2,000? Back in 2015, the average commission was roughly $7,000. Today, it’s up to $9,000 per transaction. Those numbers are coming from the median price in Maricopa County. 

In 2015 the average home value was $233,000. Every year since saw an increase, and in 2019 the average value was $306,500. I’ve been in real estate for 33 years, and that’s the highest median price I’ve ever seen. Overall, the median price has risen by 31.5% in the last five years. This, of course, helped to increase your commission. 

What are you doing with that extra commission? Do you own real estate? If you bought a property back in 2015 for $233,000, it would possibly be worth $306,000 today. That’s a considerable boost. 

“I’ve been in real estate for 33 years, and that’s the highest median price I’ve ever seen.”

My challenge for you is to buy real estate. Help your clients understand this particular model. To download the graph mentioned in the video above, click here.

If you have any questions about your rising commission, feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I would love to discuss this with you further.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 990

Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message! Today I’d like to share a story about a recent client we helped buy a home. Every REALTOR® (myself included) is quick to posts on social media about the listings that sell in hours for thousand above asking price, but we rarely share the stories that are not so easy. We think that posting about those quick sales makes us look good; however, our value comes from the transactions that are not easy or fast - and reminds our clients why they need an agent to represent them.

I received a referral a few days before Christmas from a RE/MAX agent out of state. She referred us her brother who was hired to run a large company here in the Valley. Time was of the essence as his home in California was in escrow and due to close the second week of January; with the holidays in full swing we had to act fast.

The buyer had some special needs which included a home with an acre of land, single level, room for three boys (one with special needs), four large dogs and priced in the $500,000 range – and they needed to be in by January 6th. Tonya and I went to work fast finding a home in Buckeye and after several days of negotiations we could not put the deal together, as the seller of that property could not move out that fast. So, we found another home, and the same thing happened.

We found a third property in New River and got an offer accepted on Christmas Eve and managed to get the inspection done the day after Christmas. A big shout out to our partners at Advantage Home Inspection for acting fast and helping our client! The next few days were very stressful as the listing agent had not sold a home in a long time, or perhaps never from what I could tell. She had a “DPS” destination (deal preventative specialist), and we just couldn’t get on the same page with repairs and paperwork.

My client paid for the inspection and paid for a rush appraisal to expedite the process. It became clear that we needed to find a backup, so on New Year’s Eve we made an offer on a fourth property, countered back and forth – and the buyer had to make a choice to cancel the contract on a home they loved, risk it not closing or move onto the next property. We canceled the offer on the New River property and accepted the counter on the other property on January 2nd.

I am happy to conclude this story by telling you we were able to hand our client the keys so they could move in – on January 6th! Many people think that real estate is as easy as watching a show on HGTV. Its not and in fact, it is the hardest job there is trying to handle many personalities, stress, negotiations, unprofessionalism, and high demands to hit sometimes unrealistic timelines. I am so grateful for our amazing team of experts (inspectors, lenders, title company) and a shout out to the listing agent on this property for being fast and professional in helping us put this deal together.

As a company, we are truly blessed and honored to serve many clients at a high level; most of us rely on referral business like this client. I love the easy deals, but I especially love the ones that we have an opportunity to go above and beyond to take care of our clients. This week I’d like to challenge each of you to share a story on your social media about a deal that wasn’t so easy. Let’s demonstrate our value through a different perspective. Let’s make it a great week!

“The ache for home lives in all of us, the safe place where we can go as we are and not be questioned.” - Maya Angelou

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 989

Welcome to the first Nate’s Monday Morning Message of 2020! I hope that each of you reading this had a wonderful holiday season…it’s a new year and that means its time for new goals and resolutions. However, setting a new goal or resolving to stop a bad habit is only one component of change. In order to succeed you also need to be focused.

If you desire to have better relationships, focus on being more present in the moment with those people. If you desire more confidence, focus on your self-image and the great things you have to share. If you desire more money, focus on continually doing the tasks you identified that will produce revenue and not the mundane nonsense of running your business. Focus is differentiators. Lots and lots of people can come up with a plan. Lots and lots of people have desires. The challenge for many is the focus needed to do what is needed day after day without getting thrown off track.

I’d love to know your goals for 2020! If you’d like to share them with me, shoot me back an email and if there is anything I can do to support you in the New Year, I’d love to help. Let’s make it a great week!

PS I want to give a big shout out to our very own Treedah Magee! Her annual holiday toy drive to benefit Phoenix Children’s Hospital was another smashing success. Thank you Treedah for your vision and support for our local kids – your generous heart is so appreciated by all of us at RE/MAX Professionals and every family that you touch during the holiday season!

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 988

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…it’s the last few days of 2019 and I am reminded that together we can make 2020 the best year for each and everyone of us; if we make the commitment today for that to come true.

I would ask each one of you to challenge yourself like you have never done before. No, I don’t mean start going to the gym in January and stay until February. I mean a true commitment to success in all areas of your life. Commit to be a better spouse, parent or friend. Commit to being more patient and understanding. Commit to making a positive difference in someone’s life – every day. Commit that even in the moments of challenge, that instead of getting knocked down you ride the wave to a better, brighter place.  

Let me be the first to wish you a very happy, healthy and safe New Year! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 987

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…I read an article by motivational speaker and teacher, Darren Hardy that has inspired me this holiday season. Every year during the holidays, we get into the “giving season.” We see a rush on donations for toys, food and other worthy causes, which is great but what if we were in the “giving season” every day – not just the last few weeks of the year? What if we applied the “giving season” to more than just donations and holiday gifts?

“Want courage? Give encouragement. Want hope? Give hope. Want love? Give love. Want success? Help someone else become successful.” – Darren Hardy

We are presented with little opportunities on a daily basis to make a difference, just by giving whatever you can in that moment. Giving isn’t about money or fancy gifts; the simple gesture of a kind smile to a stranger can be the best gift of all. And the gifts we give that come from the heart, are what the holiday season is truly about. My wish for you, this year and throughout the New Year is to be in the “giving season**” every day. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

‘Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house

Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;

The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,

In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;

The children were nestled all snug in their beds;

While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;

And mamma in her ‘kerchief, and I in my cap,

Had just settled our brains for a long winter’s nap,

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,

I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.

Away to the window I flew like a flash,

Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,

Gave a lustre of midday to objects below,

When what to my wondering eyes did appear,

But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer,

With a little old driver so lively and quick,

I knew in a moment he must be St. Nick.

More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,

And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:

“Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now Prancer and Vixen!

On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donner and Blitzen!

To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!

Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!”

As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,

When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;

So up to the housetop the coursers they flew

With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too—

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof

The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.

As I drew in my head, and was turning around,

Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,

And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;

A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,

And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.

His eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!

His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!

His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,

And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,

And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath;

He had a broad face and a little round belly

That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,

And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;

A wink of his eye and a twist of his head

Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,

And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,

And laying his finger aside of his nose,

And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,

And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.

But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight—

“Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!”

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“For it is in giving that we receive.” - Francis of Assisi

“Christmas is not a time nor a season, but a state of mind. To cherish peace and goodwill, to be plenteous in mercy, is to have the real spirit of Christmas.” – Calvin Coolidge

“Christmas is a season for kindling the fire for hospitality in the hall, the genial flame of charity in the heart.” - Washington Irving

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 986

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…I am sure all of you were very busy with holiday shopping, or parties, or just relaxing, or maybe even some work! As the year wraps up, and we start to prepare for 2020 we should look at back at 2019 and be proud of what we accomplished. We should take some time this week to think about all of the hurdles and victories we faced this past year.

What I like most about business is that it is never ending and always changing. That is the same with life. We wake up each and every day and we plan, and we work and life comes our way. We must remember that we make choices each and every day and those choices are only ours. Many things have tried to throw us off course and many more will come. We should expect them and when they come we will be ready and we will handle them. The reason we look back is to remind ourselves how far we’ve come in the last twelve months.

Let’s move forward with more confidence, resolve, and determination to reach our goals in the New Year – and let us have some fun along the way! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Each Day I Learn More

Each day I learn more than I teach;I learn that half knowledge of another’s lifeLeads to false judgment;I learn that there is surprising kinship In human nature;I learn that it’s a wise father who knows his own son;I learn that what we expect we get;I learn there’s more good than evil in this world;That age is a question of spirit;That youth is the best of lifeNo matter how numerous the years;I learn how much there is to learn.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.” - Steve Jobs

“Our lives are a sum total of the choices we have made.” – Wayne Dyer

“One’s philosophy is not best expressed in words; it is expressed in the choices one makes… and the choices we make are ultimately our responsibility.” - Eleanor Roosevelt

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 985

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…the first weekend of holiday shopping is behind us, and we going to increasing pulled in many directions.

This is the time of year that gets to be very, very busy! We should be thrilled to have this opportunity in our lives however, I encourage each of you to make an effort to find a little extra time.  

Spend that extra time shopping for just the right gift. Spend that extra time listening to a child talk about Santa Claus. Spend that extra time making a few phone calls to those people you may not have talked to enough throughout the year; you will never know the impact you may have on someone’s life.

Let’s focus on making those around us feel happier, more cared for, and more loved. When we can do that, we ourselves will feel more fulfilled. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

I wanted to share a word with you that I think is very fitting at this time of year - BELIEVE. I hope that all of you share this wonderful concept with all the people you care about. I hope you all never lose this magical idea - Believe. 

I Believe we have not come this far to fail or give up now. I Believe we are meant to go through storms before we see the beautiful sun. I Believe the kingdom we live in is unshakable. I Believe family become friends and friends become family. I Believe all my hard work will pay off. I Believe 2020 will be the best year of my life so far. I Believe I have the power to change anything I do not like. I Believe collectively we are stronger than we are apart. I Believe love is the solution to all problems. I Believe time brings about opportunity and thought. I Believe I have been put on this earth and in this position for a purpose. I Believe I am capable of anything as long as I have the desire to do it. I Believe I am who I am because of all the people in my life. 

What do you Believe? 

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.” - Steve Jobs

“Faith is to believe what you do not see; the reward of this faith is to see what you believe.” – Saint Augustine

“Three things are necessary for the salvation of man: to know what he ought to believe; to know what he ought to desire; and to know what he ought to do.” - Thomas Aquinas

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…I hope that each of you reading this had a lovely Thanksgiving celebration and that you were able to spend memorable time with those you cherish the most. And now the holiday season is upon us! This can be a wonderful time of year, however it can also be a very stressful.

Before you get swept away with the hustle and the bustle, I hope you will implement a bit of self-care. Remember what they tell you while preparing to take flight…you must put your airbag on first before assisting others around you. If you don’t take care of yourself first, especially during this time of year, then you can’t be there for your family and friends! Let’s make it a great week!

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 983

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…This is the time of year that we should take a moment to consider what we have to be truly thankful for…down to the smallest gestures of kindness, to the rain that quenched our desert floor last week, to the fest that will be served this Thursday in most American homes (and some aboard for those celebrating outside the U.S.) Even if you are facing a difficult time, we can still be grateful for the loving people we know, the breath in our lungs and the opportunities that lie ahead in the New Year.

As we wrap up our month of gratitudes, I hope that this daily effort will carry forward into each and every day you have in the future. Let the people you care about, know how thankful you are for them; take time to reach everyone. Let them know what they mean to you and that you appreciate them in your life. Please enjoy this time, use it wisely as once its gone, it’s gone forever.

From my family and my team please let us be the first to wish you and your loved ones a very happy, healthy and safe Thanksgiving weekend celebration…let’s make it a great week!

Thanksgiving Day Poem, Author Unknown

The year has turned its circle,The seasons come and go.

The harvest all is gathered inAnd chilly north winds blow.

Orchards have shared their treasures,The fields, their yellow grain.

So open wide the doorway,Thanksgiving comes again!

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“The thankful receiver bears a plentiful harvest.” – William Blake

“Thanksgiving Day is a good day to recommit our energies to giving thanks and just giving.”  – Amy Grant

“An optimist is a person who starts a new diet on Thanksgiving Day.” - Irv Kupcinet

“If you think Independence Day is America’s defining holiday, think again. Thanksgiving deserves that title, hands-down.” - Tony Snow

“We’re getting ready to sit down at the table and have Thanksgiving, and there’s people that are not with their families. There are people that are in dangerous areas, putting their lives on the line to keep our country free, and I think that’s something we should all celebrate every day.” - Guy Fieri

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 982

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…I am enjoying reading all your gratitudes and I appreciate the effort that you are putting into your thoughts on gratitude! And on that note, I want to share this thought with you today…we all have the ability through our thoughts and efforts to create something that has never existed before. And we have the power to chose what will be. I would like to challenge you to think about solutions, not problems. Think about how to make things better, instead of how things might be now. Think about what really matters to you. What you think about, is what you will do, and what you think about is up to you!

My gratitude today…I am in Maui attending a RE/MAX Premier Brokers conference and next week my family will be joining me for a vacation together on this island that is a slice of paradise. I am so grateful to be a part of the most recognized real estate brand in the world, and for opportunities to mastermind with some of the best in our industry…and I get to spend it in a beautiful setting! I am grateful that this amazing industry has afforded me and my family the option to travel and spend quality time together.

What are you grateful for today?

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Today is My Day

Today my thoughts are centered on expecting only the best and giving only the best. Today my mind and heart are open to new opportunities and I make the most out of every situation.

Today I will smile and act enthusiastically in everything I do. I will make every person I meet feel very important and I will show them that I care. Today my confidence is high, and I am willing to step out and take a chance. I speak freely to all those I meet. I know I have something valuable to contribute. I expect results today and my time is well invested.

Today I am one step closer to achieving my goals and dreams. I always keep my eyes focused on success and prosperity. Today I will sow good seed so that I will reap my harvest of reward. 

Today is my day!

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 981

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…my gratitude this week is for the thousands of men and women who join any branch of military service. I have a tremendous amount of respect for their bravery, honor and selflessness. We would not be the great United States of America if it weren’t for our armed forces and those who dedicate their lives protecting our freedoms. Next time you see a Veteran, buy them a cup of coffee or a meal…take the time to listen to their story and their service.

I’d also like to recognize my stepson Brennen who is currently enlisted serving our country. Thank you, Brennen…you are an inspiration and we are so proud of you!

What are you grateful for today?

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Take A Moment To Thank A Veteran

When you see someone in a uniform,Someone who serves us all,Doing military duty,Answering their country’s call,

Take a moment to thank themFor protecting what you hold dear;Tell them you are proud of them;Make it very clear.

Just tap them on the shoulder,Give a smile, and say,“Thanks for what you’re doingTo keep us safe in the USA!”

By Joanna Fuchs

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“There is a certain enthusiasm in liberty, that makes human nature rise above itself, in acts of bravery and heroism.” – Alexander Hamilton

“The U.S. Military is us. There is no truer representation of a country than the people that it sends into the field to fight for it. The people who wear our uniform and carry our rifles into combat are our kids, and our job is to support them, because they’re protecting us.” - Tom Clancy

“Duty, Honor, Country. Those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, what you will be.” – Douglas MacArthur

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 980

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…I hope this email finds you well-rested and refreshed for a new week! Before we know it, the holiday season will be here and that got me thinking about what I love about this time of year, and the word gratitude came to mind…as we know gratitude is the theme for Thanksgiving but during the hustle and bustle, gratitude can quickly fade under stress.

Over the next few weeks, I’d like to challenge each of you to start your day with three things you are grateful for…and to up the accountability, I’d love for you to email them to me! Let’s have some fun and create an attitude of gratitude throughout the month of November…I can’t wait to read your emails! Let’s make it a great week!

PS I’ll start the challenge by sharing three things I am grateful for:


  The incredible people on my team, especially Kristine who is the glue that holds us together!
  Tonya – she continues to inspire me to be a better father, a better partner and a better man!
  My children – I am so blessed to have three healthy, smart and amazing children who complete my world!

The Pencil Maker took the pencil aside, just before putting him into the box. “There are five things you need to know,” he told the pencil, “Before I send you out into the world, always remember them and never forget, and you will become the best pencil you can be.” “One: You will be able to do many great things, but only if you allow yourself to be held in someone’s hand.” “Two: You will experience a painful sharpening from time to time, but you’ll need it to become a better pencil.” “Three: You will be able to correct any mistakes you might make.” “Four: The most important part of you will always be what’s inside.” “And, Five: On every surface you are used on, you must leave your mark. No matter what the condition, you must continue to write.” The pencil understood and promised to remember and went into the box with purpose in its heart.

Now replace the place of the pencil with yourself. Always remember them and never forget, and you will become the best person you can be. One: You will be able to do many great things, but only if you allow yourself to be held in special hands and allow other human beings to access you for the many gifts you possess. Two: You will experience a painful sharpening from time to time, by going through various problems in life, but you’ll need it to become a stronger person. Three: You will be able to correct any mistakes you might make.  Four: The most important part of you will always be what’s on the inside. And, Five: On every surface you walk through, you must leave your mark. No matter what the situation, you must continue to do your duties. Allow this parable on the pencil to encourage you to know that you are a special person and that only you can fulfill the purpose to which you were born to accomplish. Never allow yourself to get discouraged and think that your life is insignificant and cannot make a change.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend.” - Melody Beattie

“As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.” - John F. Kennedy

“Gratitude is one of the strongest and most transformative states of being. It shifts your perspective from lack to abundance and allows you to focus on the good in your life, which in turn pulls more goodness into your reality.” - Jen Sincero

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 979

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…are you aware of the tremendous influence you have in this amazing world we live in?

You have the ability to make someone’s day. You can make someone smile or laugh - today. You can help someone with a problem or difficult situation - today. You can be the person that is always helpful, always encouraging, always thought of as someone people want to be around. 

Let’s take some time today and this week to really focus on truly helping others on a regular basis. You will feel great about it and that help will come back to you when needed. Let’s take the time to slow down and pay attention to what it is that we can do rather than focusing on what we don’t have control over. You have control over what you do, right now, and how you do it. Remember we must always give before we get. Let’s make it a great week!

One song can spark a moment, One flower can wake the dreamOne tree can start a forest, One bird can herald spring.One smile begins a friendship, One handclasp lifts a soul.One star can guide a ship at sea, One word can frame the goalOne vote can change a nation, one sunbeam lights a roomOne candle wipes out darkness, One laugh will conquer gloom.One step must start each journey. One word must start each prayer.One hope will raise our spirits, One touch can show you care.One voice can speak with wisdom, One heart can know what’s true,One life can make a difference, You see, it’s up to you!

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“The memories we make with our family is everything.” - Candace Cameron Bure

“People are basically the same the world over. Everybody wants the same things - to be happy, to be healthy, to be at least reasonably prosperous, and to be secure. They want friends, peace of mind, good family relationships, and hope that tomorrow is going to be even better than today.” - Zig Ziglar

“The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other’s life.” - Richard Bach

“Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Don’t wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it’s at work or with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed and savored.” - Earl Nightingale

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 978

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…as we head into he holiday season, I thought it would be a good time to focus on our relationships and ask the question: do you treat all people in your life that are special, the way they deserve to be treated?

All of us go through life and with the hustle and bustle of living we forget to make sure we don’t take for granted those special people who are around us. It could be a spouse or significant other; it could be your children or your parents. It could be your best friend or a co-worker; it could be a total stranger. 

This week, I’d like to challenge you to take five minutes to realize that we are never too busy to look into the eyes of the person or people we love for just a few extra seconds each day. Let’s take five minutes to realize we are never too busy to spend just a few more minutes playing with our kids or listening to a story from our parents. Let’s take five minutes to realize we are never too busy to help a dear friend with a problem. Let’s not be too busy in life that we miss living it. Let’s make it a great week!

Echo or Life - Unknown Author

“A son and his father were walking on the mountains. Suddenly, his son falls, hurts himself and screams, “AAAhhhhhhhhhhh!” To his surprise, he hears a voice repeating, somewhere in the mountain, “AAAhhhhhhhhhhh!” Curious, he yells, “Who are you?” He receives the answer, “Who are you?” Angered at the response, he screams, “Coward!” He receives the answer, “Coward!”

He looks to his father and asks, “What’s going on?” The father smiles and says, “My son, pay attention.” And then he screams to the mountain, “I admire you!” The voice answers, “I admire you!” Again the father screams, “You are a champion!” The voice answers, “You are a champion!” 

The boy is surprised but does not understand. Then the father explains, “People call this echo, but really this is life. It gives you back everything you say or do. Our life is simply a reflection of our actions. If you want more love in the world, create more love in your heart. If you want more competence in your team, improve your competence. This relationship applies to everything, in all aspects of life; Life will give you back everything you have given to it.”

“Your life is not a coincidence. It’s a reflection of you!”

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 977

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…last week we talked about fear and how to overcome those feelings. This week I’d like to focus on Q4 and how we can set ourselves up for a great 2020. I think a good practice for planning is taking inventory of what we did so far this year. Spend a few minutes looking at the great things that have already happened this year and all the amazing people who have come into our lives.

We use our past as a training ground for the future however, that can be limiting if we are using it as a benchmark for what we can or can not do. We want to learn from our past, but not let it control what we believe we can do, just because it has never been done before. We can all do, be and succeed at more; the sky is literally the limit. Dare to dream big and then go out and make it happen. I believe in you. Let’s make it a great week!

Building Your House - Author Unknown

An elderly carpenter was ready to retire. He told his employer-contractor of his plans to leave the house-building business to live a more leisurely life with his wife and enjoy his extended family. He would miss the paycheck each week, but he wanted to retire. They could get by. 

The contractor was sorry to see his good worker go and asked if he could build just one more house as a personal favor. The carpenter said yes, but over time it was easy to see that his heart was not in his work. He resorted to shoddy workmanship and used inferior materials. It was an unfortunate way to end a dedicated career. 

When the carpenter finished his work, his employer came to inspect the house. Then he handed the front-door key to the carpenter and said, “This is your house… my gift to you.”

The carpenter was shocked! What a shame! If he had only known he was building his own house, he would have done it all so differently. 

Success Principle:

So it is with us. We build our lives, a day at a time, often putting less than our best into the building. Then, with a shock, we realize we have to live in the house we have built. If we could do it over, we’d do it much differently.

But, you cannot go back. You are the carpenter, and every day you hammer a nail, place a board, or erect a wall. Someone once said, “Life is a do-it-yourself project.” Your attitude, and the choices you make today, help build the “house” you will live in tomorrow. Build wisely!

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.” - Helen Keller

“Once we believe in ourselves, we can risk curiosity, wonder, spontaneous delight, or any experience that reveals the human spirit.” - e. e. cummings

“The essential lesson I’ve learned in life is to just be yourself. Treasure the magnificent being that you are and recognize first and foremost you’re not here as a human being only. You’re a spiritual being having a human experience.” - Wayne Dyer

        <description>

Today’s video is about creating a solid business plan. Tune in to learn about the benefits of SWOT analysis.

Here is a tip to ensure that your business plan is effective and will lead you to success: Do a SWOT analysis on yourself. SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

You can also give the form to a spouse, co-worker, or even your favorite mortgage broker to perform the analysis on you. It’s a great way to get feedback from other people. However, don’t be upset by the feedback you receive; take that information and use it to better yourself. If you’re interested in doing using this analysis to improve your business plan, reach out to me and I’ll send you a downloadable file.

Strengths. What factors about your business ensure that you’ll get the job done for your clients? Assessing your strengths will help you reflect on the advantages your company has over others. 

Weaknesses. Where do you need to improve? Which factors prevent you from getting listings? Maybe you’re not strong enough on the closing side. Determining what you’re not doing as well as you could be will help you improve your plan and have more success.

“Don’t be upset by the feedback you receive; take that information and use it to better yourself.”

Opportunities. Your strengths are internal, but your opportunities are external. For example, both interest rates and inventory are very low right now and iBuyers are prevalent in the industry; how can you take some of these opportunities and incorporate them into your business plan?

Threats. These are somewhat the opposite of your opportunities—what obstacles do you face? A lot of people think that Zillow and other iBuyers are threats, but even if they are a threat to you, your goal should be to learn everything you can about them and try to turn them into opportunities. We’ve witnessed that happening even here. A local agent started a Facebook page to get input from people about iBuyers and then created a whole iBuyer platform to educate Realtors about the iBuyer business. He took a threat and turned it into an opportunity, and you can, too.

If you have any questions about today’s topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you in more detail.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 976

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message…anything is possible, you are possible…did you commit to mastery this week? Did you commit to yourself; to your dreams and goals? Do you really believe that anything is possible? Or are you like many people who live in fear of pursuing their dreams and goals? Daily I see people within my company who are literally paralyzed by fear…fear of rejection, fear that they lack enough skill, fear that there isn’t enough business. So today, I’d like to share an acronym with you about the word fear.

FEAR:(F) False(E) Evidence(R) Appearing(R) Real

False evidence appearing real, just like anything we make-up in our minds, whether it is true or false, the feeling we attach to it, determines whether it is good or bad…or in other words, fear or happiness. Most people fail to realize that fear has the exact same emotional feeling in our bodies as excitement or happiness does. Fear can stop us dead in our tracks, while excitement can drive us to greatness. You get to decide…fear or excitement? I hope this week you choose excitement. Let’s make it a great week!

The Elephant Rope

As a man was passing the elephants, he suddenly stopped, confused by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg. No chains, no cages. It was obvious that the elephants could, at any time, break away from their bonds but for some reason, they did not.

He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away. “Well,” trainer said, “when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.”

The man was amazed. These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they couldn’t, they were stuck right where they were.

Like the elephants, how many of us go through life hanging onto a belief that we cannot do something, simply because we failed at it once before?

Failure is part of learning; we should never give up the struggle in life.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Action is a great restorer and builder of confidence. Inaction is not only the result, but the cause, of fear. Perhaps the action you take will be successful; perhaps different action or adjustments will have to follow. But any action is better than no action at all.” – Norman Vincent Peale

“Fear is a powerful beast. But we can learn to ride it.” - Justine Musk

“I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.” - Nelson Mandela

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 975

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message! This week, I want to share a quote from one of my favorite public figures, Tony Robbins: “One reason so few of us achieve what we truly want is that we never direct our focus; we never concentrate our power. Most people dabble their way through life, never deciding to master anything in particular.”

When I read this quote, there are two words that stand out the most and those are “power” and “mastery.” We are powerful beings, capable of doing and being whatever we can imagine possible, yet as this quote points out, most of us “dabble” our way through life, playing it safe or even worse, living in fear. Why is that?

I believe it is because we do not commit to mastery. The dictionary’s definition of the word “mastery” means to command the expert skill or knowledge. The only way we become a master of anything in life is to commit or focus our efforts 110+ percent. What can you do today to get out of fear and into mastery? What is one action you can take? Anything is possible…YOU are possible. So, dare to dream and dare to commit to mastery. Let’s make it a masterful week!

All the Difference in the World

Every Sunday morning, I take a light jog around a park near my home.  There’s a lake located in one corner of the park.  Each time I jog by this lake, I see the same elderly woman sitting at the water’s edge with a small metal cage sitting beside her.

This past Sunday my curiosity got the best of me, so I stopped jogging and walked over to her.  As I got closer, I realized that the metal cage was in fact a small trap.  There were three turtles, unharmed, slowly walking around the base of the trap.  She had a fourth turtle in her lap that she was carefully scrubbing with a spongy brush.

“Hello,” I said.  “I see you here every Sunday morning.  If you don’t mind my nosiness, I’d love to know what you’re doing with these turtles.”

She smiled.  “I’m cleaning off their shells,” she replied.  “Anything on a turtle’s shell, like algae or scum, reduces the turtle’s ability to absorb heat and impedes its ability to swim.  It can also corrode and weaken the shell over time.”

“Wow!  That’s really nice of you!” I exclaimed.

She went on: “I spend a couple of hours each Sunday morning, relaxing by this lake and helping these little guys out.  It’s my own strange way of making a difference.”

“But don’t most freshwater turtles live their whole lives with algae and scum hanging from their shells?” I asked.

“Yep, sadly, they do,” she replied.

I scratched my head.  “Well then, don’t you think your time could be better spent?  I mean, I think your efforts are kind and all, but there are fresh water turtles living in lakes all around the world.  And 99% of these turtles don’t have kind people like you to help them clean off their shells.  So, no offense… but how exactly are your localized efforts here truly making a difference?”

The woman giggled aloud.  She then looked down at the turtle in her lap, scrubbed off the last piece of algae from its shell, and said, “Sweetie, if this little guy could talk, he’d tell you I just made all the difference in the world.”

The moral:  You can change the world – maybe not all at once, but one person, one animal, and one good deed at a time.  Wake up every morning and pretend like what you do makes a difference.  It does.

        <description>

About three years ago, I decided to change my business based on some coaching that I received: I started to focus on setting up a perfect weekly schedule. Since then, I haven’t had a perfect week, but I have been working to use data to time block my day-to-day activities.

Before then, I probably worked between 50 and 70 hours a week. Today I’m working somewhere around 45 hours a week at max, but I’m earning more and I’m enjoying life more.

If you look at my weekly schedule (see 1:28 in the video above), you’ll see that it doesn’t have any appointments scheduled on Saturday or Sunday or anytime after 6 p.m.

“If you can focus your time into compartments each day and then review your schedule for efficiency, you can both change your life and your financial success.”

Here’s a general overview of my perfect week:


  5 a.m.: Wake up to start my “miracle morning activities”: reading, journaling, exercising, and meditating
  5:30 or 6 a.m.: Arrive at the gym to work out for an hour 
  7:30 a.m.: Take my daughter to school
  9:30 a.m. on Monday mornings: Attend a call with the leadership of RE/MAX Professionals for 30 minutes
  10 a.m. to 11 a.m.: Attend a team meeting from 11 to 11:30, where I review last week’s numbers: what I accomplished, what my team accomplished, and how my company overall performed
  11 a.m.: Take a one-hour lunch break
  1 p.m. to 2 p.m.: Do some follow-up calls
  2 p.m. to 3 p.m.: Meet with agents who are considering joining our company
  3 p.m. to 6 p.m.: Blocked out to take listing appointments


That’s merely a general overview; certain days of the week have different periods blocked out for specific activities:


  Tuesdays from 7 a.m. to noon: Coaching calls
  Wednesdays from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m.: Meeting with RE/MAX leadership
  Thursday mornings: Training classes
  Friday mornings: Blocked out for golf


If you can focus your time into two compartments each day and then review your schedule for efficiency, you can both change your life and your financial success.

If you’d like me to work with you to help you design a perfect week, feel free to reach out to me. We can set up an appointment for coffee or a Zoom call and I can show you in more detail how the perfect week has helped me change my life for the better. Hope to hear from you soon!

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 974: the Month of Miracles Grand Total

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message! Last week in our monthly business meeting we announced the grand total of fundraising that our offices generated during the month of August, and today I’d like to share that success with you!

Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals® raises funds and awareness for 170 member hospitals that provide 32 million treatments each year to kids across the U.S. and Canada. Donations stay local with our Phoenix Children’s Hospital and go to fund critical treatments and healthcare services, pediatric medical equipment and charitable care. Since 1983, Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals has raised more than $5 billion!

Which brings me to our totals for this year…collectively our agents and offices were able to raise $21,263.10 which is more than double the goal we set for the Month of Miracles. For the past eighteen years we have continued to fundraise for our local PCH and because of the support we receive from our generous agent and loyal clients we have donated more than $450,000 year to date! I want to thank each of you reading this for your contribution – we could not have done this without you! Let’s make it a great week!

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 973: Remembering 9/11

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message! Today I want to remember the 2,753 people who perished in the World Trade Center attacks that occurred on 9/11/2001. That day is a day that will be forever remembered in our hearts and in our country. For me, my family and my team, it will always be the day that we took a giant leap of faith, in the midst of confusion, chaos and heartbreak and forged forward with the first day that RE/MAX Professionals opened its doors.

We are proud of the company we have become today and so, so grateful that we live in a country which affords us the opportunities we have. I hope this week you will take a moment to remember those brave men and women who were the first responders on 9/11, as well as the many lives who were lost and the families who were impacted. We live in a great nation and 9/11 is a day that should never be forgotten or taken for granted! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

We’re Still Standing by Hannah Schoechert, 7th grade student

Those twin towersStanding tall with pride,Fell with grieving hearts.Stunned, America cried.

But we’re still standing.

Bin Laden triedTo crush our land,But we stood our groundWith our flag in hand.

And we’re still standing.

Red for valorAnd the blood that fell.White for purityOur heroes tell.

Blue for the justiceThat will be done,Proving once moreThese colors don’t run.

And we’re still standing.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“America was not built on fear. America was built on courage, on imagination and an unbeatable determination to do the job at hand.” - Harry S Truman

“We, the People, recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights; that our destinies are bound together; that a freedom which only asks what’s in it for me, a freedom without a commitment to others, a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism, is unworthy of our founding ideals, and those who died in their defense.” - Barack Obama

“I believe our flag is more than just cloth and ink. It is a universally recognized symbol that stands for liberty, and freedom. It is the history of our nation, and it’s marked by the blood of those who died defending it.” - John Thune

        <description>

Today I want to give you a few tips about how to maintain and track successful habits in your business.

Here in the office, my team uses something called the Daily Success Habits Tracker, and I want to take some time today to tell you about how it can help you.

Over my career in real estate, I’ve found that agents either have good habits or bad habits. Obviously, the goal is to take those bad habits and transform them into good habits.

With the Daily Success Habits Tracker, we are able to focus on making sure each day is productive. Here’s how it works:

Essentially, the tracker is a kind of chart that we’ve attached a point-system to. The left column tracks the time throughout the day in half-hour increments. The center column lists the “61 Points of Rhythm,” which are 61 daily activities that are necessary to maintaining business; each activity is given a certain number of points, which you earn if you complete the tasks. Each task, such as prospecting via phone calls, can be completed more than once to earn multiple points.

“This tracker is a good way to hold yourself accountable to productive activities.”

The column on the right allows you to track your prospecting times for the various sessions you do throughout the day. At the top of the tracker, there is a dial tracker to allow you to see how many calls you made during your day.

To see a visual representation of the tracker and to hear various examples in which agents can earn points, refer to 0:42 in the video above.

Overall, this tracker is a good way to hold yourself accountable to productive activities, to help you look back on your day to see what you did right and wrong, and to help you improve your overall business production.

If you have any questions about the Daily Success Habits Tracker or would like a copy it for your own purposes, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 972

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message! I hope that this email is finding each of you enjoying your hard-earned day off! Labor Day is the sign that summer is coming to an end, school is back in session and hopefully the days of triple digits are coming to a close!

This day marks a moment in history where the hardworking men and women who forged the labor movement in the 1800s to ensure our rights in both socially and economically were represented. The rights we enjoy today were fought for many years ago and we have the American workers to thank.

From my family to yours, we want to wish you each a very happy, healthy and safe Labor Day celebration! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

CAN’T by Edgar Guest

Can’t is the worst word that’s written or spoken;Doing more harm here than slander and lies;On it is many a strong spirit broken,And with it many a good purpose dies.It springs from the lips of the thoughtless each morningAnd robs us of courage we need through the day:It rings in our ears like a timely-sent warningAnd laughs when we falter and fall by the way.Can’t is the father of feeble endeavor,The parent of terror and half-hearted work;It weakens the efforts of artisans clever,And makes of the toiler an indolent shirk.It poisons the soul of the man with a vision,It stifles in infancy many a plan;It greets honest toiling with open derisionAnd mocks at the hopes and the dreams of a man.Can’t is a word none should speak without blushing;To utter it should be a symbol of shame;Ambition and courage it daily is crushing;It blights a man’s purpose and shortens his aim.Despise it with all of your hatred of error;Refuse it the lodgment it seeks in your brain;Arm against it as a creature of terror,And all that you dream of you some day shall gain.Can’t is the word that is foe to ambition,An enemy ambushed to shatter your will;Its prey is forever the man with a missionAnd bows but to courage and patience and skill.Hate it, with hatred that’s deep and undying,For once it is welcomed ‘twill break any man;Whatever the goal you are seeking, keep tryingAnd answer this demon by saying: “I can.”

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 970

“Every time a football player goes to ply his trade, he’s got to play from the ground up – from the soles of his feet right up to his head. Every inch of him has to play. Some guys play with their heads. That is okay. You’ve got to be smart to be number one in any business. But more importantly, you’ve got to play with your heart, with every fiber of your body. If you’re lucky enough to find a guy with a lot of head and a lot of heart, he’s never going to come off the field second.” Vince Lombardi

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message! With football season right around the corner, I thought I would share one of my favorite quotes from the great Vince Lombardi. Each of you have goals, dreams and aspirations but in order to truly live a life we love, it takes guts, it takes sweat, it takes heart and sometimes it takes tears. It takes knowing what you want with every fiber of your body and going for it with passion and tenacity. It takes never giving up no matter the obstacles you face. I challenge you this week to take the leap you have been waiting for…face the fears…wipe away the tears and dig down deep. Do what it takes to make your life one that makes your want to jump out of bed each morning because you get to be YOU! Let’s make it a great week!

P.S. This is the last week of this year’s Month of Miracles! Please help us reach our goal of One Million Pennies to benefit our local Phoenix Children’s Hospital. You can make a donation online at: https://rem.ax/2yvmXTo

Everyone Has a Story in Life

A 24-year-old boy seeing out from the train’s window shouted, “Dad, look the trees are going behind!”

Dad smiled and a young couple sitting nearby, looked at the 24-year old’s childish behavior with pity, suddenly he again exclaimed, “Dad, look the clouds are running with us!”

The couple couldn’t resist and said to the old man…“Why don’t you take your son to a good doctor?”

The old man smiled and said, “I did, and we are just coming from the hospital, my son was blind from birth, he just got his eyes today.”

Every single person on the planet has a story. Don’t judge people before you truly know them. The truth might surprise you.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 970

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message! We are about halfway through the 2019 Month of Miracle to benefit our local Phoenix Children’s Hospital. I would like to extend a special invitation to each of you to join us on Friday, August 23rd for our second annual live auction event.

Last year our Month of Miracles events surpassed our goal of one million pennies and raised more than $18,000 to benefit PCH – and the live auction event raised more than $6,400.00 in just two hours! We have a generous list of items that will be available on Friday, ranging from a variety of gift backsets, foursome golf packages, Cardinal tickets and two tickets to see Cher in her upcoming tour! This event starts on Friday, August 23rd at 5:30pm and we will be hosting it again this year at Salt Tacos y Tequila at Westgate.

Please feel free to share this invite with your family, friends and favorite businesses (we are still accepting donations for the live auction and would love your support if you own a business or have a favorite!). We hope to see you there! Let’s make it a great week!

P.S. If you are not able to attend the live auction, you can still support our fundraising efforts by making a donation online: https://rem.ax/2yvmXTo

        <description>

No matter if you’re a Realtor® or you offer some other service to buyers and sellers in the Valley, Nate’s List benefits all.

Is your list of quality vendors to refer your clients to pretty short right now? 

In light of the current construction boom in our Phoenix marketplace, I know mine is, and I’d like to add to my network. To achieve that, my team and I are looking to build an amazing client service list—Nate’s List, as we call it. 

When it comes to mortgage lenders, title, and insurance, we have some deeply established relationships already, but our goal is to cast our net a little wider and foster relationships with all sorts of vendors who service buyers and sellers. 

Since starting RE/MAX Professionals nineteen years ago, we’ve served around 60,000 clients across the Valley—many of whom would like to enlist the help of a professional, highly reputable provider to fill their specific needs. 

Nate’s List will feature everything from landscapers to pool cleaners to clothing cleaners and more. If you provide a service that buyers and sellers can benefit from, I’d like to be the conduit between you and our past clients.

“Our goal is to cast our net a little wider and foster relationships with all sorts of vendors who service buyers and homeowners.”

Here are just a few examples of questions we’ve recently received from clients: “Do you know someone who can put a snake fence up?” “Do you know someone who can do a plumbing repair?” “Do you know someone who can install an electrical plug for my electric car?” And the list goes on and on! 

In closing, if you’re a Realtor® and you’d like to build your own database full of amazing service providers, I’d be happy to sit down with you and discuss what we’re doing to make this happen. If you’re a vendor and you’d like to bring value to our clients, please fill out this form and let us know what sort of expertise you have to offer. No matter your area of specialty, I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 969

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message! Today I would like to ask you what this statement means to you: “money doesn’t grow on trees.” What does that remind you of? How does it make you feel? For me, it is a reminder of how far I have come both personally and professionals, and how different life is for my three children. Growing up in Maryvale with a single mom who struggled to make ends meet, money didn’t grow on trees and she had to work hard for the money we did have. And I know many of you reading this can relate.

I decided at a young age that I would have a different relationship with money. I chose to let money work for me, not against me. If we believe that making money is a hard, then it will always be hard. True, money doesn’t grow on trees, however, our attitudes and beliefs towards money impact how easily and frequently it comes into our lives. Instead of telling yourself that “money doesn’t grow on trees,” change the dialogue to be more in alignment with the goals you have in life in which you need money to support. Two of my favorites are: “my necessities are met with abundance” and “I live in a world of abundance.” Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

The Taoist Farmer

This farmer had only one horse, and one day the horse ran away. The neighbors came to condole over his terrible loss. The farmer said, “What makes you think it is so terrible?”A month later, the horse came home, this time bringing with her two beautiful wild horses. The neighbors became excited at the farmer’s good fortune. Such lovely strong horses! The farmer said, “What makes you think this is good fortune?”The farmer’s son was thrown from one of the wild horses and broke his leg. All the neighbors were very distressed. Such bad luck! The farmer said, “What makes you think it is bad?”A war came, and every able-bodied man was conscripted and sent into battle. Only the farmer’s son, because he had a broken leg, remained. The neighbors congratulated the farmer. “What makes you think this is good?” said the farmer.*As told by Executive editor, Elise Hancock, in the Johns Hopkins Magazine, November 1993, page 2, in section entitled Editor’s Note.

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 968

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message! The beginning of August marks the official start of our fundraising efforts for the Month of Miracles, to benefit our local Phoenix Children’s Hospital. And today I’d like to share a little bit about why we participate in this worthy cause.

Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals® raises funds and awareness for 170 member hospitals that provide 32 million treatments each year to kids across the U.S. and Canada. Donations stay local to fund critical treatments and healthcare services, pediatric medical equipment and charitable care. Since 1983, Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals has raised more than $5 billion, most of it $1 at a time through the charity’s Miracle Balloon icon. Its various fundraising partners and programs support the nonprofit’s mission to save and improve the lives of as many children as possible.

Last year our Month of Miracles events surpassed our goal of one million pennies and raised more than $18,000 to benefit our local Phoenix Children’s Hospital – additionally throughout the year in 2018 our agents contributed $47,000 in donations! We could not do it without our generous agents, our family, friends and of course our loyal clients who continue to trust us with their real estate needs. I hope we can depend on your support again this year. You can stop by any one of our three Valley office locations, or made a donation online: https://rem.ax/2yvmXTo

I want to thank you in advance for your donations! Let’s make it a great week!

        <description>

The 2018 Characteristics of New Housing Report is here, and I have all the key statistics to share with you.

What does the 2018 Characteristics of New Housing Report say about last year’s national housing market?

First of all, it said that 840,000 single-family homes were built, and they had the following characteristics: 


  10% had two bedrooms or less
  45% had three bedrooms
  45% had four bedrooms or more 
  36% of homes had three or more bathrooms (when I first got into real estate 33 years ago, a home with more than two bathrooms outside of the luxury market was unheard of)
  The median size was 2,386 square feet


Of the 617,000 single-family homes sold in 2018, the following numbers were reported:


  75% were purchased using conventional financing
  6% were purchased using cash
  The median sale price was $326,400
  The average sale price was $385,000
  The median size was 2,435 square feet


“All in all, our market is fairly strong.”

When we look at the NAR statistics for all residential sales, there were 5,340,000 in total. The average days on market for those homes was 120 days. Here are the year-over-year statistics so far for 2019:


  Home sales are up 2.7%
  Supply is up 2.4%
  The average days on market has risen to 130 days


Here’s what was recorded for the Phoenix area, in particular:


  Resale home sales are up 4.3%
  New inventory is up 4.1%
  The average sale price is $347,500
  The median price is $278,000
  The average days on market is 65 days 


All in all, our market is fairly strong, and I hope this information helps you with your buying and selling plans moving forward in 2019. If you have any other questions about our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

“Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.” - Steve Jobs

Nate’s Monday Morning MessageVolume 966

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message! Today I would like to focus on failure, or better yet the courage it takes to keep going in the face of adversity. We have all faced a difficult time or two in our lives, but what made us get back up and continue moving forward? What pushed us to keep trying? I want to remind you about a few important people in history who didn’t give up, even when the odds were stacked again them…

Thomas Edison: was considered one of the most prolific inventors in history, was told as a boy he was too stupid to learn anything. He tried more than 9,000 experiments before he was successful in creating the first light bulb. There are now 1,093 U.S. patents in his name.

Michael Jordon: was known today as one of the greatest basketball players of all times, was removed from his high school basketball team because of his “lack of skill.”

Steven Spielberg: American film director who has won multiple Academy Awards and considered one of the most successful filmmakers ever, dropped out of junior high school. He later came back and was placed in a learning-disabled class. He dropped out of school for good just one month later.

These are just a few of the countless stories of highly successful people who have failed or who have been told they couldn’t do it, and yet surprised the world because they had a dream. Don’t give up on your dreams, whatever they are…don’t give up! Let’s make it a great week!

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.” - Helen Keller

Nate’s Monday Morning Message

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message! We all face similar challenges in our lives, and we all handle those challenges differently. There a few things that we all could do better to make the challenges that will come a little easier to handle. First, keep in mind that there will always be challenges and disruptions that throw us off course; that is life and we all go through it. Second, your reaction to what happens to you is 100 percent within your control. You may not control what happens, but you control what you do about it. Third, pointing fingers or placing blame on others never solves the problem at hand. The goal is to understand what happened why and what you learned from it. Then move on. Fourth, love more and argue less. Spend your time loving rather than arguing with many. Fifth, realize your time here is limited and the clock is ticking. Don’t waste time because once it’s gone, you can’t get it back. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

It’s the Journey That’s Important by John McLeod

Life, sometimes so wearyingIs worth its weight in goldThe experience of travelingLends a wisdom that is old

Beyond our ‘living memory’A softly spoken prayer:”It’s the journey that’s important,Not the getting there!”

Ins and outs and ups and downsLife’s road meanders aimlessly?Or so it seems, but somehowLeads us where we need to be,

And being simply humanWe oft question and compare…“Is the journey so importantOr the getting there?”

And thus it’s always beenThat question pondered down the agesBy simple people with simple waysTo wise and ancient sages…

How sweet then, quietly knowingReaching destination fair:“It’s the journey that’s important,Not the getting there!“ 

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars.” - Og Mandino

“If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.” - Henry David Thoreau

“I can’t change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.” - Jimmy Dean

Nate’s Monday Morning Message

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message! I hope that each of you reading this are enjoying the summer so far and prepared for the monsoon season that is quickly approaching! This time of year, in the Valley of the Sun provides much needed water for the desert and the monsoons give us some pretty amazing sunsets. I hope that you will take some time during the evenings this summer to enjoy the awe-inspiring clouds and vivid colors that fill our sky; it truly is magnificent and a perfect reminder of the simple blessings that surround us every day. We often stare at a door that has closed for too long and in the process miss the one that has opened. Don’t take for granted the simple beauties in life, as they pave the way to finding a deeper meaning to happiness. Take time to appreciate all the good in your life and make each moment count! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

A Fish Stranded in a Drying Puddle

Once there was a fellow walking along a road. Suddenly he heard a faint cry. He looked around but saw nothing. Thinking he heard nothing, he continued to walk. Again he heard the faint cry. This time the call was nearby. He searched high and low, and found the sound was coming out of a little fish lying in a drying pond. His mouth gurgling. That person looked at the fish strangely and asked,”Was that you who was just calling me? Was it you needing my help?”The small fish looking pleading at the man gasping and breathless said, “Please save me quickly, I am dying, I need water. I am not a normal fish, rather I am the eastern sea dragon’s official. Please give me a little water.” That person hearing this hurriedly nodded his head and said, “I understand, I will immediately go to the south and let the southern king redirect a river to here so that you can swim and return to the eastern sea.” The fish angrily cried out, “Can a fish live out of water? I am only in need of a little water. Your idea is pointless. I think that the next time you see me will be in a shop that sells dried fish. “The story tells us to reconsider solutions that we usually propose to solve real life problems. Sometimes we take our time too much to find the most ideal solution, while what the problem really needs is time critical solution.We must always aware that many times in our lives we don’t need the best solution but some quick fixes for the current situation to prevent it of becoming worse. Only until then, we have much more time to think and find the ideal solution.

        <description>

Telling the right stories can help you secure more clients, and today I’ll explain how.

I recently read an article that explained how sellers lost $14 billion in equity last year because of the increasing number of iBuyers entering our market. Selling to these companies is usually advertised as a convenient deal, but is actually a very ineffective move for today’s sellers. 

So, what can you do to dissuade sellers from going that route? One of the simplest ways is by doing what you do best: offering expert real estate advice.

“You can use personal success stories of the clients you’ve helped to secure future clients.”

Given that 71% of buyers are afraid to buy a home that needs work, some of the best advice you can offer sellers is to make strategic repairs. The right repairs and upgrades will not only bring a high return, but they’ll also help sellers to close quickly and for top dollar. 

Once you’ve guided a seller to closing using this (or any other tips), you can use the success stories that come out of these experiences to help you secure future clients who might have otherwise considered selling to an iBuyer.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Nate’s Monday Morning Message

Welcome to another edition of Nate’s Monday Morning Message! As we are constantly working on improving ourselves and our situations, we try to make things better each day, in big and small ways. The challenge becomes the consistency of doing it.

Like many things in life they get harder to do over time and we need to dig deeper and deeper to find the strength and determination to succeed. What it comes down to is passion. Do you have the passion to achieve the goal that you are working towards? Do you have the passion to put up with the bad with the hope that the good will be so very worth it? You must find your passion in everything you do. It is a mindset and it can be created over and over and over if you desire the end result bad enough. Passion is the gas that runs your engine. Find yours and put it to work! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

L- Love: your passion is something you love to do.I- Interest: your passion is something that interests you.F- Fulfilling: your passion gives you a sense of fulfillment.E- Empowering: your passion usually empowers and energizes you.

P- Personal: your passion has personal significance to you and you alone.A- Abilities: your passion capitalizes on your assets, attributes and abilities.S- Service: your passion will usually provide a service or fulfill a need.S- Spiritual: your passion and its pursuit represent an area of spiritual growth.I- Inspiring: your passion is inspiring to you and therefore will inspire others too.O- Obvious: your passion, once found, is usually something obvious to you.N- Natural: your passion is often unstudied and comes naturally to you.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.” - Harriet Tubman

“Follow your passion, be prepared to work hard and sacrifice, and, above all, don’t let anyone limit your dreams.” - Donovan Bailey

“There is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living.”- Nelson Mandela

Nate’s Monday Morning Message

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message! This morning, I wanted to remind all of you of the 5 P’s of Life: Prior - Planning - Prevents - Poor - Performance. To be truly successful in all we do both personally and professionally, planning is a must! We must plan for what we need to do and also plan for the different roadblocks that may and most likely will get in our way.

When these roadblocks pop-up we will be prepared and able to act quickly. Once we have our plans, we can go after our goals with the passion, determination, and focus to be successful. Spending a small amount of time in the beginning can save you a bunch of time in the end. Remember that you must also take action! Taking action is honestly the single biggest differentiator to success. Follow the 5 P’s and take action EVERYDAY! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Principles of Life:

Winning isn’t everything but wanting to win is.

You would achieve more, if you don’t mind who gets the credit.

When everything else is lost, the future still remains.

Don’t fight too much or the enemy will know your art of war.

The only job you start at the top is when you dig a grave.

If you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall for everything.

If you do little things well, you’ll do big ones better.

Only thing that comes to you without effort is old age.

You won’t get a second chance to make a first impression.

Only those who do nothing do not make mistakes.If you are not failing, you’re not taking enough risks.

Don’t try to get rid of your bad temper by losing it.

If at first you don’t succeed, skydiving is not for you.

Those who don’t make mistakes usually don’t make anything.

There are two kinds of failures: Those who think and never do, and those who do and never think.

Pick battles big enough to matter, small enough to win.

All progress has resulted from unpopular decisions.

Change your thoughts and you change your world.

Understanding proves intelligence, not the speed of the learning.

There are two kinds of fools in this world: Those who give advice and those who don’t take it.

Management is doing things right.

Leadership is doing the right things.

Friendship founded on business is always better than business founded on friendship.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“When it is obvious that the goals cannot be reached, don’t adjust the goals, adjust the action steps.” – Confucius

“Successful people maintain a positive focus in life no matter what is going on around them. They stay focused on their past successes rather than their past failures, and on the next action steps they need to take to get them closer to the fulfillment of their goals rather than all the other distractions that life presents to them.” - Jack Canfield

“Vision without action is merely a dream. Action without vision just passes the time. Vision with action can change the world.” - Joel A. Barker

Nate’s Monday Morning Message

Welcome to Nate’s Monday Morning Message! Over time we accumulate things that are a result of our hard work and determination. However, let us keep in mind that the tangible possessions around us are not the reason for living, but rather the result of a life lived properly. The people and the experiences we have are so much more valuable than any item we may acquire.

Let this week’s message be a reminder to be present in all that you do. Slow down and concentrate on the conversations you are having with your children, spouse, or other loved ones. Slow down and enjoy the thoughts that you may have about experiences of the past. Slow down and think about all the great people and opportunities that are surrounding you each day. Commit to living a life you truly enjoy…and let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

The Coffee

A group of alumni, highly established in their careers, got together to visit their old university professor. Conversation soon turned into complaints about stress in work and life. Offering his guests coffee, the professor went to the kitchen and returned with a large pot of coffee and an assortment of cups - porcelain, plastic, glass, crystal, some plain looking, some expensive, some exquisite - telling them to help themselves to the coffee.

When all the students had a cup of coffee in hand, the professor said: “If you noticed, all the nice looking expensive cups were taken up, leaving behind the plain and cheap ones. While it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves, that is the source of your problems and stress. Be assured that the cup itself adds no quality to the coffee in most cases, it’s just more expensive and in some cases even hides what we drink.

What all of you really wanted was coffee, not the cup, but you consciously went for the best cups… and then began eyeing each other’s cups.

Now consider this: Life is the coffee, and the jobs, money and position in society are the cups. They are just tools to hold and contain Life, and the type of cup we have does not define, nor change the quality of Life we live. Sometimes, by concentrating only on the cup, we fail to enjoy the coffee.”

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

Nate’s Monday Morning Message

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Message…its hard to believe it is already June, which means that school is out, vacations are on the horizon and of course, the temperatures will soar into the triple digits! Amid the summertime fun, we must not lose sight of our goals and ambitions in life. So this week, I’d like to talk about persistence. We need to focus on a plan and putting action steps in place so we can remain on track over the next few months.

The challenge of doing anything worthwhile is being able to do what is necessary over and over and not giving up – which is persistence. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Growing Good Corn, Author Unknown 

There once was a farmer who grew award-winning corn. Each year he entered his corn in the state fair where it won a blue ribbon.  

One year a newspaper reporter interviewed him and learned something interesting about how he grew it. The reporter discovered that the farmer shared his seed corn with his neighbors.

“How can you afford to share your best seed corn with your neighbors when they are entering corn in competition with yours each year?” the reporter asked.

“Why sir,” said the farmer, “didn’t you know? The wind picks up pollen from the ripening corn and swirls it from field to field. If my neighbors grow inferior corn, cross-pollination will steadily degrade the quality of my corn. If I am to grow good corn, I must help my neighbors grow good corn.”

He is very much aware of the connectedness of life. His corn cannot improve unless his neighbor’s corn also improves.

So it is with our lives. Those who choose to live in peace must help their neighbors to live in peace. Those who choose to live well must help others to live well, for the value of a life is measured by the lives it touches. And those who choose to be happy must help others to find happiness, for the welfare of each is bound up with the welfare of all.

The lesson for each of us is this: if we are to grow good corn, we must help our neighbors grow good corn. It is possible to give away and become richer! It is also possible to hold on too tightly and lose everything. Yes, the liberal man shall be rich! By watering others, he waters himself.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. Napoleon Hill

“Ambition is the path to success, persistence is the vehicle you arrive in.” - William Eardley IV

“Persistence is a secret weapon for everyone.” - Liu Wen

Nate’s Monday Morning Message

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Message! Over the weekend, as I spent time with my family it got me thinking about how we spend our time whether it is at work or at play or simple hanging out at home. Are we really making the best use of our time each and every day? Are there times when if we planned a little better, we could get more done? Do we wish we had more time to spend on the things we truly love? There is a solution to maximizing our time.

Set a goal, create a plan, and then accomplish it. This will be our challenge for this week. If you found 30 minutes a day, what would you do with it? Think long and hard about this answer as this will be what you think about while figuring out what you can change around, do differently, or eliminate from your schedule. Time is the one thing that is equal among all of us. How we use it is what makes all the difference in the world. Use it wisely for once it is gone it can never be replaced. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Take Time

Take time to laughIt is the music of the soul.

Take time to thinkIt is the source of power.

Take time to playIt is the source of perpetual youth.

Take time to readIt is the fountain of wisdom.

Take time to prayIt is the greatest power on earth.

Take time to love and be lovedIt is a God-given privilege.

Take time to be friendlyIt is the road to happiness

Take time to giveIt is too short a day to be selfish

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Successful people maintain a positive focus in life no matter what is going on around them. They stay focused on their past successes rather than their past failures, and on the next action steps they need to take to get them closer to the fulfillment of their goals rather than all the other distractions that life presents to them.” - Jack Canfield

“In every day, there are 1,440 minutes. That means we have 1,440 daily opportunities to make a positive impact.” - Les Brown

“Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow.” - Helen Keller

Nate’s Monday Morning Message

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Message! I hope everyone had a wonderful Mother’s Day celebration! As we prepare ourselves for another amazing week, let us keep in mind that what we choose to do with our time is completely up to us. We can choose to be in a great mood, or we can choose not to. We can choose to focus on the things in our lives we have control over, or we can choose not to. We can choose to work harder, smarter, and more creatively than our competition or we can choose not to. What do you have control over and what will you do about it? The wonderful thing about life is that it is all up to us. Focus on actions and the results will follow. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

We shall do much in the years to come,But what have we done today?

We shall give out gold in a princely sum,But what did we give today?

We shall lift the heart and dry the tear,We shall plant a hope in the place of fear,

We shall speak the words of love and cheer,But what did we speak today ?

We shall be so kind in the after while,But what have we done today?

We shall bring to each lonely life a smile,But what have we brought today?

We shall give to truth a grander birth,And to steadfast faith a deeper worth,

We shall feed the hungering souls of earth,But whom have we fed today?

We shall reap such joys in the by and by,But what have we sown today?

We shall build us mansions in the sky,But what have we built today? 

`Tis sweet in the idle dreams to bask;But here and now, do we our task?

Yet, this is the thing our souls must ask,What have we done today?

By: Nixon Waterman

Nate’s Monday Morning Message

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Message! I want to take this opportunity to wish each of you reading this who are mother’s - including those who are step-moms and grandmother’s doing double duty - a very happy Mother’s Day celebration this coming weekend.

I also want to give a big shout out to my daughter Brandi for being an amazing mother to my granddaughter, Hayden. It is a joy I can’t describe to see my child raising her own child with such grace, confidence, love and compassion. To my partner Tonya, who is the mother of my youngest daughter Mila, I want to thank you for your constant dedication to our family, to our home and the efforts you put into raising our daughter to be a bright, loving, ambition young lady. I could not do it without you.

Lastly to my own Mother, I want to say thank you for helping me to become the man I am today. I know it was not an easy journey raising me and my siblings by yourself and I want you to know that there isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t thank you for your dedication, love and strength.

I hope that you will each take a moment this week and over the weekend to thank your own mom on this Mother’s Day celebration. Let’s make it a great week!

Nate’s Monday Morning Message

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Message! I hope you all had a fabulous weekend and that you found some time to relax and refresh before hitting the ground running for another amazing week. Remember the reasons why you work so hard: accomplishment, satisfaction, provide for your family, build wealth, charter new waters, fine tune your skills, competition, etc.  

Please take five minutes this Monday morning to remember and really think about why you do what you do. The purpose behind your actions is what will get you through difficult times. The goals that you set are the markers of success and achievement. They will guide you on the journey. The actions you take daily are what move you forward little by little to achieve all that you desire. Keep your purpose in sight and work hard on the actions that will lead to your success.  And remember, never, never, never quit! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Climb ‘Til Your Dream Comes TrueWrittenby Helen Steiner Rice

Often your tasks will be many, And more than you think you can do. 

Often the road will be rugged And the hills insurmountable, too.

But always remember, the hills aheadAre never as steep as they seem, 

And with Faith in your heart start upwardAnd climb ‘til you reach your dream. 

For nothing in life that is worthyIs ever too hard to achieve

If you have the courage to try it, And you have the faith to believe.  

For faith is a force that is greaterThan knowledge or power or skill, 

And many defeats turn to triumphIf you trust in God’s wisdom and will.  

For faith is a mover of mountains, There’s nothing that God cannot do, 

So, start out today with faith in your heart, And climb ‘til your dream comes true!

Nate’s Monday Morning Message

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Message! I hope everyone enjoyed the Easter holiday weekend! Let’s start out this week taking a few minutes to examine where we are in both our personal and business lives. 

Do we have a stated purpose for both? Do we have a plan to achieve the result desired? Are we working each and every day on the actions that our plan calls for? Are we happy? Do we need to make some changes or work a little harder or smarter to achieve our goals? Are we allowing negative people or thoughts to influence us?

We decide what we will or will not do. We have control over what thoughts will or will not influence us. We choose to act the way we do every minute of every day. If we choose to, we have the power to change anything in our lives for the better. I would love to hear from you on what you plan to do this week to get you closer to your purpose in life! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

“Storms Bring Out the Eagles, But the Little Birds Take Cover.” - Helen Steiner Rice

When the “storms of life”

Gather darkly ahead,

I think of these wonderful words 

I once read.

And I say to myself 

As “threatening clouds” hover,

Don’t “fold up your wings”

And “run for cover.”

But like the eagle,

“Spread wide your wings”

And “soar far above”

The troubles life brings.

For the eagle knows

That the higher he flies,

The more tranquil and brighter 

Become the skies. 

And there is nothing in life

God ever asks us to bear 

That we can’t soar above 

“On the wings of prayer.”

And in looking back over

The “storm you passed through,”

You’ll find you gained strength 

And new courage, too.

For in facing “life’s storms”

With an eagle’s wings,

You can fly far above 

Earth’s small, petty things.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Learn to get in touch with the silence within yourself, and know that everything in life has purpose. There are no mistakes, no coincidences, all events are blessings given to us to learn from.” - Elisabeth Kubler-Ross

“What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.” - Zig Ziglar

“Successful people maintain a positive focus in life no matter what is going on around them. They stay focused on their past successes rather than their past failures, and on the next action steps they need to take to get them closer to the fulfillment of their goals rather than all the other distractions that life presents to them.” - Jack Canfield

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Message! What is it that we are going to accomplish this week? In order to success at anything we set out to do, we need a plan.

You can and you should; the time is now. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

The Rocks and Sand Experiment

A philosophy professor stood before his class and had some items in front of him. When class began, wordlessly he picked up a large empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks, rocks about 2” in diameter.

He then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was. So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas between the rocks.

He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was. The students laughed. The professor picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else. “Now,” said the professor, “I want you to recognize that this is your life. The rocks are the important things - your family, your partner, your health, your children - anything that is so important to you that if it were lost, you would be nearly destroyed. The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, your car.”

“The sand is everything else. The small stuff. If you put the sand into the jar first, there is no room for the pebbles or the rocks. The same goes for your life. If you spend all your energy and time on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take your partner out dancing. There will always be time to go to work, clean the house, give a dinner party and fix the disposal.”

“Take care of the rocks first - the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.”

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Stay true to yourself, yet always be open to learn. Work hard, and never give up on your dreams, even when nobody else believes they can come true but you. These are not clichés but real tools you need no matter what you do in life to stay focused on your path.” - Phillip Sweet

“I learned that we can do anything, but we can’t do everything… at least not at the same time. So think of your priorities not in terms of what activities you do, but when you do them. Timing is everything.” -Dan Millman

“Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.” - Harriet Tubman

Should Realtors be concerned about new technology in real estate? Our panel of experts weighed in on this topic recently.

There’s recently been a lot of hype surrounding new technology in real estate. Whether it’s from OpenDoor, Zillow, or any other number of companies, there is no shortage of online homebuyers who are looking to make instant offers on homes for sale. As Realtors, should we be worried about this new level of competition?

We recently discussed this issue with a panel of experts from RE/MAX Professionals on how they navigate the market now that these direct buyer programs have entered the fray.

Some of the topics we discussed include:


  Strategies for representing both sellers and buyers through iBuyer programs
  Scripting techniques and negotiating commissions when working with direct buyers
  How you can demonstrate your value as an agent compared to a technology company
  Setting expectations for service fees and repairs on a listing
  How to proceed when a client has received a previous offer from a direct buyer


Watch this short video to view a few highlights from this panel discussion so you can stay ahead of the curve when dealing with new trends in real estate technology.

If you’d like to view the full hour-long discussion, you can watch it in its entirety here.

As always, if you have any questions or there’s anything I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Message! Today I want to write about persistence. The challenge of doing anything meaningful in life, is being able to do what is necessary over and over and not giving up, even with it gets hard. This is the part that we must focus on daily. A plan without action is worthless. We need enough persistence to continuously work the plan day-in and day-out. Persistence will get us to where we want to be…and what need to achieve a big dream. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Growing Good Corn, Author Unknown

There once was a farmer who grew award-winning corn. Each year he entered his corn in the state fair where it won a blue ribbon.

One year a newspaper reporter interviewed him and learned something interesting about how he grew it. The reporter discovered that the farmer shared his seed corn with his neighbors.

“How can you afford to share your best seed corn with your neighbors when they are entering corn in competition with yours each year?” the reporter asked.

“Why sir,” said the farmer,” didn’t you know? The wind picks up pollen from the ripening corn and swirls it from field to field. If my neighbors grow inferior corn, cross-pollination will steadily degrade the quality of my corn. If I am to grow good corn, I must help my neighbors grow good corn.”

He is very much aware of the connectedness of life. His corn cannot improve unless his neighbor’s corn also improves.

So it is with our lives. Those who choose to live in peace must help their neighbors to live in peace. Those who choose to live well must help others to live well, for the value of a life is measured by the lives it touches. And those who choose to be happy must help others to find happiness, for the welfare of each is bound up with the welfare of all.

The lesson for each of us is this: if we are to grow good corn, we must help our neighbors grow good corn. 

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Success is almost totally dependent upon drive and persistence. The extra energy required to make another effort or try another approach is the secret of winning.” - Denis Waitley

“The most interesting thing about a postage stamp is the persistence with which it sticks to its job.” - Napoleon Hill

“Success is not a matter of mastering subtle, sophisticated theory but rather of embracing common sense with uncommon levels of discipline and persistence.” - Patrick Lencioni

THE BEAUTY OF MATHEMATICS

BE sure to read to the END…Just the math part is good enough, the end is even better. 

1 x 8 + 1 = 9 12 x 8 + 2 = 98 123 x 8 + 3 = 987 1234 x 8 + 4 = 9876 12345 x 8 + 5 = 98765 123456 x 8 + 6 = 987654 1234567 x 8 + 7 = 9876543 12345678 x 8 + 8 = 98765432 123456789 x 8 + 9 = 987654321  

1 x 9 + 2 = 11 12 x 9 + 3 = 111 123 x 9 + 4 = 1111 1234 x 9 + 5 = 11111 12345 x 9 + 6 = 111111 123456 x 9 + 7 = 1111111 1234567 x 9 + 8 = 11111111 12345678 x 9 + 9 = 111111111 123456789 x 9 +10= 1111111111  

9 x 9 + 7 = 88 98 x 9 + 6 = 888 987 x 9 + 5 = 8888 9876 x 9 + 4 = 88888 98765 x 9 + 3 = 888888 987654 x 9 + 2 = 8888888 9876543 x 9 + 1 = 88888888 98765432 x 9 + 0 = 888888888  

1 x 1 = 1 11 x 11 = 121 111 x 111 = 12321 1111 x 1111 = 1234321 11111 x 11111 = 123454321 111111 x 111111 = 12345654321 1111111 x 1111111 = 1234567654321 11111111 x 11111111 = 123456787654321 111111111 x 111111111 = 12345678987654321  

Mind Boggling… Now, take a look at this… 

From a strictly mathematical viewpoint: What Equals 100%? What does it mean to give MORE than 100%?  

Here’s a little mathematical formula that might help answer these questions:  

If: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  Is represented as: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26.  

Then: H-A-R-D-W-O- R- K  8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98% 

And: K-N-O-W-L-E- D-G-E 11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+ 5 = 96% 

But: A-T-T-I-T-U- D-E 1+20+20+9+20+ 21+4+5 = 100% 

Attitude Matters!!! 

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Only one who devotes himself to a cause with his whole strength and soul can be a true master. For this reason, mastery demands all of a person.” Albert Einstein

“Your attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude.” - Zig Ziglar

“I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.” - Bruce Lee

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Message…I am going to keep this email short and sweet this week! We are almost through the first quarter of 2019. How are you doing with your goals? Are you working a plan to achieve them? We’ve got to work a little harder than the competition, innovate, create and then level up. But remember to smile and have fun, be caring and compassionate, and make a difference. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Just for Today! Written by Sybyl F Partridge in 1916 and printed in “How to Stop Worrying, And Start Living” by Dale Carnegie, 1951


  
    Just for today I will be happy.  This assumes that what Abraham Lincoln said is true, that “most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.” Happiness is from within; it is not a matter of externals.
  
  
    Just for today I will try to adjust myself to what is, and not try to adjust everything to my own desires. I will take my family, my business, and my luck as they come and fit myself to them.
  
  
    Just for today I will take care of my body. I will exercise it, care for it, nourish it, not abuse nor neglect it, so that it will be a perfect machine for my bidding.
  
  
    Just for today I will try to strengthen my mind. I will learn something useful. I will not be a mental loafer. I will read something that requires effort, thought and concentration.
  
  
    Just for today I will exercise my soul in three ways; I will do somebody a good turn and not get found out. I will do at least two things I don’t want to do as William James suggests, just for exercise.
  
  
    Just for today I will be agreeable. I will look as well as I can, dress as becomingly as possible, talk low, act courteously, be liberal with praise, criticize not at all, nor fault with anything and not try to regulate nor improve anyone.
  
  
    Just for today I will try to live through this day only, not to tackle my whole life problem at once.  I can do things for twelve hours that would appall me if I had to keep them up for a lifetime.
  
  
    Just for today I will have a program. I will write down what I expect to do every hour.  I may not follow it exactly, but I will have it.  It will eliminate two pests, hurry and indecision.
  
  
    Just for today I will have a quiet half hour all by myself and relax. In this half hour sometimes I will think of God, so as to get a little more perspective into my life.
  
  
    Just for today I will be unafraid, especially I will not be afraid to be happy, to enjoy what is beautiful, to love, and to believe that those I love, love me.
  


If we want to develop a mental attitude that will bring us peace and happiness, here is rule # 1: Think and act cheerfully, and you will feel cheerful.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.” - Tony Robbins

“What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.” - Zig Ziglar

“People with goals succeed because they know where they’re going.” - Earl Nightingale

“If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us.” - Jim Rohn

        <description>Nate’s Monday Morning Message



Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Message! I trust that each of you reading this had a wonderful weekend, filled with enjoyment and memories made. Today, I want to talk to you about fairness and understanding. Many of us heard as children that “life just is not fair.” I am not sure that I agree, because you see life is what you make of it, and fairness is subjective. We all know people who are deliberate, thoughtful, and fair. We also know people who are non-deliberate, non-thoughtful and not very fair.

I would encourage you to take a look at yourself and ask if you are deliberate, thoughtful, and fair. Regardless of what life has done for you up until today, the future is a clean canvas and you are the painter. Make wise choices and be fair and understanding. Life will bring back to you what you give to others. Let’s make it a great week!

Nate’s Monday Morning Message

Welcome to this week’s edition of Nate’s Monday Message! We spend a lot of time thinking about all the things we need to fix or improve in our lives. However, what amount of time do we spend being proud of what we have accomplished so far, or feeling thankful for the blessings we currently have? Let us focus some of our attention on those items this week and every week going forward. True, we must work hard, but we also need to look at how far we’ve come, and smile. Life is a journey of experiences! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

My Dog Can Walk on Water

There was a hunter who came into the possession of a special bird dog. The dog was the only one of its kind, because it can walk on water. One day he invited a friend to go hunting with him so that he could show off his prized possession. After some time, they shot a few ducks, which fell into the river. The man ordered his dog to run and fetch the birds. The dog ran on water to fetch the birds. The man was expecting a compliment about the amazing dog but did not receive it. Being curious, he asked his friend if the friend had noticed anything unusual about the dog. The friend replied, “Yes, I did see something unusual about your dog. Your dog can’t swim!”

Moral of the story: More than 90 percent of the people that we face every day are negative. They choose to look at the hole in the middle rather than the doughnut. Do not expect compliments or encouragement from them. These are the people who cannot pull you out of your present situation. They can only push you down. So be aware of them, spend less time with them, and do not let them steal your dreams away from you.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Appreciation is a wonderful thing: It makes what is excellent in others belong to us as well.” - Voltaire

“A healthy attitude is contagious but don’t wait to catch it from others. Be a carrier.” - Tom Stoppard

“When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around.” - Willie Nelson

“Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend.” - Melody Beattie

Nate’s Monday Morning Message

Welcome to this edition of Nate’s Monday Message! Are you prepared for the success that you are about to have? This is one of the biggest things that holds people back from success: the fear of success itself. But did you know that fear has the same physical emotion in the body as extreme excitement? It is all in how we label what we feel. Fear merely stands for: false evidence appearing real. Be prepared for the success you have working towards, and it is more likely to happen. Put yourself in a position to succeed in all aspects of your life daily. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Just BE THANKFUL 

Be thankful that you don’t already have everything you desire. If you did, what would there be to look forward to? Be thankful when you don’t know something, for it gives you the opportunity to learn new things. Be thankful for the difficult times. Those are the times you grow. Be thankful for your limitations, because they give you opportunities for improvement. Be thankful for your mistakes. They will teach you valuable lessons for the future. 

Be thankful when you are tired and weary, because it means you’ve made a difference. It’s easy to be thankful for the good things. A life of rich fulfillment comes to those who are also thankful for the setbacks and bumpy times. Find a way to be thankful for your troubles, and they can become your blessings. 

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do.”- Pele

“If you want to conquer fear, don’t sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.” - Dale Carnegie

“Without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning.” - Benjamin Franklin

“The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” - Franklin D. Roosevelt

        <description>

Today I want to give you my professional advice about how to track your leads.

At one point in my 33-year career, I used to only track where my closings came from. But about two years ago, I was introduced to tracking every lead—how it comes in, the source, and our conversion rate. Let me give you an example:

You do an open house and you get five leads. You add the five leads to the tracker, including their name, address, phone number, and you include the source (the open house, in this case). Additionally, if they give you the information that they’re interested in buying or selling, you’ll want to categorize them in the tracker accordingly.

On our lead-tracking spreadsheet, we have all that information recorded, plus, the first contact date with the lead, the next contact date scheduled with them, and also the value of that lead—for example, a buyer looking to purchase in the $300,000 price range. From there, we can calculate a $9,000 projected commission.

Looking at my 2018 tracker, I notice that we had 213 leads come in, 45 of which came in with an income potential of $912,000. My leads had an average of $20,000 in potential income per lead.

“Knowing exactly how much return you get on your leads and their sources is vital.”

By tracking our leads, I’ve found that we’re able to save money and/or move our money away from something that isn’t giving us the conversion we’re looking for and put it towards something with a higher conversion. Last year, we underwent 10 months of parallel tracking for two different high-cost marketing for internet leads. 

For example, after tracking Zillow and a pay-per-click service, we found that one of those was producing three times the amount of revenue as the other. Because we could see that, we stopped paying money for one and then doubled down on the one that was working. Don’t be afraid to stop investing in something that isn’t working because you’re afraid of losing a possible lead that will come in. Knowing exactly how much return you get on your leads and their sources is vital, no matter if you’re running a team or if you’re working as an individual.

Here are some other interesting facts our tracker also tells me about our 2018 business:


  11% came from agent and client referrals
  22% was tracked all the way to close
  26% came from open houses
  9% came from Zillow
  4% came from sign calls
  5% came from our sphere of influence


At the end of the day, we know exactly where all our leads are coming from. I challenge you to start tracking each and every one of your own leads so that you can identify which sources are worth investing in.

If you have any questions about lead tracking, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to speak with you.

Welcome to this edition of Nate’s Monday Message…Happy President’s Day! There are many things in life that we have control over, and many things that we do not. But most importantly, we have choices and we get to choose to start each day with the proper mindset. We get to choose our own actions, and what we will do or not do today. You can’t control others, but you can choose how you interact with them. You can’t control the outcome, but you can choose how you react to it. This week, make it a point to focus on your choices, and you will find that you have more control that you realize. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow - Author Unknown

There are two days in every week about which we should not worry. Two days which should be kept free from fear and apprehension.One of these days is yesterday with its mistakes and cares,Its faults and blunders, Its aches and pains.Yesterday has passed forever beyond our control.All the money in the world cannot bring back yesterday.We cannot undo a single act we performed.We cannot erase a single word we said. Yesterday is gone.The other day we should not worry about is tomorrow.With its possible adversities, its burdens, Its large promise and poor performance.Tomorrow is also beyond our immediate control.Tomorrow’s Sun will rise, either in splendor or behind a mask of clouds, but it will rise.Until it does, we have no stake in tomorrow, for it is yet unborn.This just leaves only one day . . . Today.Any person can fight the battles of just one day.It is only when you and I add the burdens of those two awful eternity’s - yesterday and tomorrow that we break down.It is not the experience of today that drives people mad.It is the remorse or bitterness for something which happened yesterday and the dread of what tomorrow may bring.Let us therefore live but one day at a time.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” - Winston Churchill

“Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.” - Bruce Lee

“Every day brings new choices.” - Martha Beck

“Today I choose life. Every morning when I wake up, I can choose joy, happiness, negativity, pain… To feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices - today I choose to feel life, not to deny my humanity but embrace it.” - Kevyn Aucoin

Welcome to this edition of Nate’s Monday Message…Love is in the air as the day for lovers is just around the corner! Whether you are in a committed relationship, or still search for the “one” Valentine’s Day is a day to celebrate what love truly means. It isn’t about the flowers or the chocolates, but more importantly about an expression of our emotions for those we hold near and dear, beyond a romantic relationship. I hope you will take a moment this week to say “I love you” to those who need to hear. I want to wish each of you reading this email a very happy Valentine’s Day! Let’s make it a great week!

Nate’s Monday Morning Message

Welcome to this edition of Nate’s Monday Message! The weather has been a little unusual for the Valley of the Sun this winter, and this week brings us more rain and cooler temps. There is one thing for certain though, and that is seasons always change and the sun will always rise - in our lives and our businesses.

Are you prepared to make the most out of this week? Are you organized; determined; motivated; and just all around ready to succeed? Take a few minutes today to sit quietly and gather your thoughts. What are the five things you must do this week to be a success? What are the five things you must not do this week to be a success? Write them down and keep them with you. We must be prepared to succeed. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Everything Happens for The Good  

There was once a King who had a wise adviser. The adviser followed the King everywhere, and his favorite advice was, “everything happens for the good.” One day the King went hunting and had a little accident. He shot an arrow at his own foot and was injured. He asked the adviser what he thought about the accident, to which the adviser replied, “Everything happens for the good.” This time the King was really upset and ordered for his adviser to be put in prison. The King asked his adviser, “Now, what do you think?” The adviser again replied, “Everything happens for the good.” So, the adviser remained in prison. 

The King later went on a hunting trip, this time without the adviser. The King was then captured by some cannibals. He was taken to the cannibals’ camp where he was to be the evening meal for the cannibals. Before putting him into the cooking pot he was thoroughly inspected. The cannibals saw the wound on the King’s foot and decided to throw him back into the jungle. According to the cannibals’ tradition, they would not eat anything that was imperfect. As a result, the King was spared. The King suddenly realized what his adviser said was true. The adviser also escaped death because had he not been in prison, he would have followed the King on the hunting trip and would have ended up in the cooking pot. 

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“The roots of all goodness lie in the soil of appreciation for goodness.” - Dalai Lama

“If you don’t like something, change it. If you can’t change it, change your attitude.” - Maya Angelou

“Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do.” – Pele

“People may hear your words, but they feel your attitude.” - John C. Maxwell

Welcome to this edition of Nate’s Monday Message! I hope you all had a fantastic weekend and were able to spend quality time with your family and friends. We all work hard, and we are often times so dedicated to our careers that we forget to enjoy the little things. We need to find time every day, every week to celebrate the small things that make a difference both at work and at home. Let us remember that we don’t live to work, but rather work to live!

This week, let’s commit to our family and friends; to the people we love. If we don’t make them a priority, then what is it that we are working towards? Priorities are the people and things we place value on. What are yours? Decide. Commit. Then do. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

It’s Up to YouAuthor - unknown

One song can spark a moment,One flower can wake the dream.One tree can start a forest,One bird can herald spring.One smile begins a friendship,One handclasp lifts a soul.One star can guide a ship at sea,One word can frame the goal.One vote can change a nation,One sunbeam lights a room.One candle wipes out darkness,One laugh will conquer gloom.One step must start each journey,One word must start each prayer.One hope will raise our spirits,One touch can show you care.One voice can speak with wisdom,One heart can know what’s true.One life can make the difference,You see, IT’S UP TO YOU!

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Don’t wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it’s at work or with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed and savored.” - Earl Nightingale

“Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness.” - John C. Maxwell

“To enjoy good health, to bring true happiness to one’s family, to bring peace to all, one must first discipline and control one’s own mind. If a man can control his mind he can find the way to Enlightenment, and all wisdom and virtue will naturally come to him.” - Buddha

Welcome to this edition of Nate’s Monday Message. Today I want to honor the memory of Martin Luther King, Jr. by sharing with you a part of his I have a dream speech from August 1963. It doesn’t take an extraordinary person to make history; it just takes a dream. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Martin Luther King’s I have a dream speech August 28, 1963

I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.”

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

I have a dream today.

I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.

I have a dream today.

I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exhalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” - Martin Luther King, Jr.

“Faith is taking the first step even when you don’t see the whole staircase.” - Martin Luther King, Jr.

“The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.” - Martin Luther King, Jr.

Welcome to this edition of Nate’s Monday Message. I had the pleasure of hearing author Mark Sanborn speak this last week at the Leverage ’19 real estate event in Scottsdale. He talked about an acronym he developed to help us stay on track with our goals. I want to share that with you today…

F.I.T. which stands for frequency, intensity and technique.

Successful people do the things that they need to do to produce the results every single day (frequency). They also give 110% of their effort (intensity) and they use the right technique. The definition of insanity is doing the same over and over again and expecting a different result. Focusing on the right technique is vital, combined with frequency and intensity. F.I.T. can be applied to anything you want to accomplish, including that list of New Year’s Resolutions you wrote down such as losing weight, saving more money or spending more time with family and friends. How can you apply F.I.T. to your life? Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Focus: The 5%/95% Rule

Focus 5% on what you fear 95% on getting educated and skilled to face it.  

Focus 5% on the problem 95% on the healthiest solution.  

Focus 5% on the mistake 95% on learning from it.  

Focus 5% on who to blame 95% on making sure to heal.  

Focus 5% on what you must do 95% on enjoying the process of it.  

Focus 5% on the conflict 95% on the win-win-win resolution.  

Focus 5% on what you can’t control 95% on what you do have control over.  

Focus 5% on what others say 95% on what you believe.  

Focus 5% on what you have 95% on what you want to have.  

Focus 5% on reading this 95% on applying it.

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

“Successful people maintain a positive focus in life no matter what is going on around them. They stay focused on their past successes rather than their past failures, and on the next action steps they need to take to get them closer to the fulfillment of their goals rather than all the other distractions that life presents to them.” - Jack Canfield

“I don’t focus on what I’m up against. I focus on my goals and I try to ignore the rest.” - Venus Williams

“Give yourself a gift of five minutes of contemplation in awe of everything you see around you. Go outside and turn your attention to the many miracles around you. This five-minute-a-day regimen of appreciation and gratitude will help you to focus your life in awe.” - Wayne Dyer

        <description>

Welcome to the first Monday Morning Message on 2019! Let’s talk about resolutions and what is important for the New Year. Have you taken time to really think about what it is that you truly desire? How did you get to where you are today? The vast majority of people wake-up every day and go through the motions of what they have to do, and not necessarily what they want to do.

I would like to challenge you this year to live a more purposeful life; to be conscious of all the decisions you make (or don’t make). The only difference between you and the those who are living life on purpose is how you decide to spend your time. Let us resolve for 2019, to put the things that matter most, first. Let us resolve today that we will not let another week, or another year, go by without us taking full control and responsibility for all of our actions. Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

Beginning Today (Author Unknown)

Beginning today I will no longer worry about yesterday.It is in the past and the past will never change.Only I can change by choosing to do so.

Beginning today I will no longer worry about tomorrow.Tomorrow will always be there, waiting for me to make the most of it.But I cannot make the most of tomorrow without firstmaking the most of today.

Beginning today I will look in the mirror and I will see a person worthy of my respect and admiration. This capable person looking back at me is someone I enjoy spending timewith and someone I would like to get to know better.

Beginning today I will cherish each moment of my life.I value this gift bestowed upon me in this world and I will unselfishlyshare this gift with others. I will use this gift to enhance the lives of others.

Beginning today I will take a moment to step off the beaten path and torevel in the mysteries I encounter.I will face challenges with courage and determination.I will overcome what barriers there may be which hinder my quest for growth and self-improvement.

Beginning today I will take life one day at a time, one step at a time.Discouragement will not be allowed to taint my positive self-image,my desire to succeed or my capacity to love.

Beginning today I walk with renewed faith in human kindness.Regardless of what has gone before, I believe there is hopefor a brighter and better future.

Beginning today I will open my mind and my heart.I will welcome new experiences. I will meet new people.I will not expect perfection from myself nor anyone else: perfection does not exist in an imperfect world.But I will applaud the attempt to overcome human foibles.

Beginning today I am responsible for my own happiness and I will do things that make me happy . . .admire the beautiful wonders of nature, listen to my favorite music,pet a kitten or a puppy, soak in a bubble bath . . .pleasure can be found in the most simple of gestures.

Beginning today I will learn something new; I will try something different; I will savor all the various flavors life has to offer.I will change what I can and the rest I will let go.I will strive to become the best me I can possibly be.

Beginning today. And every day.

        <description>Welcome to this week’s Monday Morning Message…it’s the last day of 2018, which means there is still a small window of time to mark off your list, hit that final goal or connect with a long-lost friend or family member. As we close the chapter on another year, I wanted to share the lyrics to Elton John’s song The Circle of Life, which is perfect timing for today’s message. Let’s welcome the New Year by celebrating the circle… and miracle of life! Let’s make it a great week!

ENCOURAGEMENT CORNER

The Circle of Life (Music by Elton John, Lyrics by Tim Rice, From the soundtrack of “The Lion King”)

From the day we arrive on the planetAnd blinking, step into the sunThere’s more to see than can ever be seenMore to do than can ever be done

There’s far too much to take in hereMore to find than can ever be foundBut the sun rolling highThrough the sapphire skyKeeps great and small on the endless round

It’s the circle of lifeAnd it moves us allThrough despair and hopeThrough faith and love

Till we find our placeOn the path unwindingIn the circleThe circle of life

It’s the circle of lifeAnd it moves us allThrough despair and hopeThrough faith and love

Till we find our placeOn the path unwindingIn the circleThe circle of life

WORDS OF INSPIRATION

The new year stands before us, like a chapter in a book, waiting to be written. We can help write that story by setting goals. Melody Beattie

And now we welcome the new year. Full of things that have never been. Rainer Maria Rilke

Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. Oprah Winfrey

        <description>

Creating a business plan will ensure you meet your goals. Here’s how.

I’ve talked before about the success cycle, and today we’ll be using an aspect of that cycle in our discussion on business plans: clarity. Clarity helps you know exactly what goals you want to achieve, and creating a business plan is the best way to achieve your goals.

When writing a business plan, there are a few things I recommend you do. First, do a SWOT analysis, which is essentially a self-examination of your own strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Jot down these categories on a piece of paper and make a list for each one. You can ask others, such as loved ones or even real estate professionals, to do a SWOT analysis on you as well. This is a good way to find out things from another perspective (things you may not have admitted to yourself). 

After you have a good list from your SWOT analysis, also think about including a marketing plan for the full 12 months of 2019. In my almost 33 years in real estate, I’ve noticed that most real estate agents have no sort of plan whatsoever. However, the successful ones do. Having a plan on how many blogs you’re going to write, how many postcards you’ll send out, or how you’ll attain leads are all ways to ensure a successful plan.

“Clarity helps you know exactly what goals you want to achieve, and creating a business plan is the best way to achieve your goals.”

Including a clear vision statement of what you want by the end of 2019 will help set the course you need to follow. Let’s say you want to close 100 transactions next year—how will you achieve this? You’ll break down how many listings you’ll need to take each month, how many buyer presentations you’ll need to go on, etc. I have some powerful tools that can help crunch the numbers on how much business you need to attract to meet your goals.

All agents are different; some like working with expired listings, some use direct mail, some use open houses, and so on. I’d be more than happy to help you create a customized plan that focuses on what you like to do—just reach out to me. Together we can create a path for you to follow in the new year.

Following the success cycle can help you accomplish the big goals you’ve set for 2019.

I recently attended a Tony Robbins event, and one of the powerful topics he covered was the success cycle. To help you find more success in your own real estate endeavors, I’ll be sharing Tony’s success cycle with you today.

The success cycle is made up of four parts: potential, action, results, and belief/certainty.

Each one of us has the potential to do anything we set our mind to. Let’s use an example goal of completing 100 transactions in 2019. Our actions will determine how we close these transactions. 

As we do this, we need to track our results. For example, we need to know what our conversion ratio is when we meet with a seller. If you go on 10 listing appointments and gain a client through five, you have a 50% conversion ratio. Once you have this ratio, you can figure out how many listing appointments you’ll need to go on to achieve your goal of 100 transactions in 2019.

You may have taken action, but if you don’t have the belief or certainty in what you’re trying to achieve, it will be difficult to get things done. 

I’d like to share a story with you about belief and certainty. Many years ago, I went to a CRS conference where some attendees wore a color-coded dot on their badge. This dot meant they had done 100 transactions that year, and most people wearing these dots were speaking about their success on stage. I had never heard of anybody doing 100 transactions in a year, but once I learned how it could be done, I was certain I could do it. At this same conference the next year, I was able to wear the coveted dot on my badge.

“If you don’t have the belief or certainty in what you’re trying to achieve, it will be difficult to get things done.”

If you want to achieve greater things in 2019, reach out to me and we can figure out a plan that works for you. I’d be more than happy to coach you throughout the year and help you hit each goal you set. In the meantime, let me know if you have any questions or need more information. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

Are you following your ethical responsibility as a Realtor to do the right thing? Today, we’ll discuss why this is important and what it entails.

Over the past few months, ethical concerns have been top-of-mind for Phoenix buyers, sellers, and homeowners. As a Realtor myself, I have noticed the rise of a few problematic trends within the industry. 

First, there’s the matter of how showings are conducted. There is a set of instructions real estate professionals are supposed to follow when showing properties. Lately, many Realtors are ignoring these guidelines. This must change. Following the showing instructions will improve the process for everyone involved. Ignoring these guidelines, meanwhile, can engender feelings of ill will. Remember: You aren’t the only person who your actions affect. 

If you were to cancel a showing or show up late without giving the seller notice, for example, imagine how disheartening this might be for them. Treating everyone’s time as being as valuable as your own is simply the right thing to do. 

In addition to this problem, there’s also the issue of showing agents not providing sellers with feedback. Oftentimes, the seller of a property will ask that showing agents tell them what they thought by filling out a short questionnaire. This questionnaire is usually sent via email, and it’s generally very easy to complete. Taking the few moments required to provide this feedback is the least we as Realtors can do.

“Each choice you make will shape the way our industry is viewed as a whole.”

Also, make sure this feedback isn’t too generic. Saying that the “buyer didn’t like the house” with no additional reason or context isn’t good feedback at all. 

When making decisions as an agent, put yourself in the seller’s shoes. As professionals, we must never disregard their time, needs, and feelings. Each choice you make will shape the way our industry is viewed as a whole.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

What if I told you that you could increase your business just by remembering “3, 2, 1?” Here’s what I mean.

I’ve got a great tip for all of you agents out there today. It’s a simple way to communicate with 1,250 people over the next 12 months. 

If you were to talk with 1,250 people in the next year, do you think your business would be better than it is now? It definitely would. Here’s how the “3, 2, 1” method works.

First, focus on calling three past clients or other people from your SOI every day and have a conversation with them. If you do this each day, Monday through Friday, that would equal 750 contacts over the course of the year. 

Next, focus on prospecting each day until you find two possible leads you can add to your SOI. That’s another 500 contacts over the course of the year.

If you were able to close just 1% of those contacts, that’s an additional 12.5 transactions per year. 

“Calling three people per day will result in an additional 1,250 touches per year.”

Finally, you need to take some time out of each week to learn one new thing. Whether it’s a lesson from a webinar, a book, or a conference, learning something new every week will give you 52 new pieces of knowledge each year. If you can work in one referral per day to someone in your SOI, that is a huge bonus.

I hope you use this method to increase your business and have more success in the coming year. If you have any questions about the “3, 2, 1” method or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Are we headed for a crash? Let’s discuss this crucial question.

Recently, a lot of people have been asking us whether the market is going to crash. 

In our local Phoenix area, the economy and the new construction market are booming. This is very similar to what we saw before the last market crash, but this doesn’t necessarily mean history will repeat itself. 

During the last crash, a lot of investors were entering our market with the intention of riding out potential appreciation. Today, though, the prospect of appreciation isn’t the primary driving force behind most home purchases. This fact alone highlights the stark contrast between our market now and what we saw years ago. 

The bottom line is this: We may experience a correction within the next year or two, but today’s market conditions are a far cry from what was the case during the last crash. 

“We may experience a correction within the next year or two, but today’s market conditions are a far cry from what was the case during the last crash.”

        <description>

What role the earnest money deposit plays in a real estate transaction impacts buyers and sellers in different ways.

In a real estate transaction, earnest money is a dollar amount that buyers put down as a deposit to show the seller that they’re sincere. What should buyers and sellers know specifically about this earnest money deposit, though?

If you’re a buyer, I recommend an earnest money deposit of at least 1% of your total offer—maybe even 2% if you’re in a multiple offer situation. For example, if your offer is $500,000, your earnest money deposit should be $5,000 (or perhaps $10,000). Your earnest money deposit is protected by the purchase contract we have here in Arizona, and there are many ways you can get it back if the deal falls through as long as you’re bargaining in good faith.

“I recommend an earnest money deposit of at least 1% of your total offer.”

If you’re a seller, you want to get as much earnest money back as possible because you’re the one who’s liable in this situation. If your house is off the market for two months and the buyer doesn’t qualify at the last minute, you’ll have to relinquish that money—you won’t be able to reclaim it.

However, if the buyer gets to close of escrow, they’re completely funded, and they meet all other contingencies, but for whatever reason they just decided not to close, then you’d be completely refunded for having your house off the market for that long.

If you have any other questions about the earnest money deposit, real estate contracts, or the home buying process in general, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.

        <title>How Interest Rates Will Affect Your Clients</title>

        <description>

Interest rates are predicted to continue rising. Today I want to take a look at what it means for your clients.

Today I want to take a minute to talk about a common topic in the real estate industry: interest rate predictions.

Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, predicts that the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond will go up 5% in the next 24 to 36 months. Typically the spread between the 10-year Treasury bond and a 30-year mortgage is about a 1.75% yield. The yield as of August 7 for a 30-year mortgage is 4.75% with a spread of 1.77%. If the yield goes to 5% then the 30-year mortgage rates rise to 6.75%

With these interest rate changes, your clients’ buying power will of course be affected. For example, if they were to buy a home for $290,000 with 5% down, their payment would be $1,437. However, if they wait until the interest rate increases to 6.75%, that same loan would give them a payment of $1,786 per month. This $349 increase in interest paid per month is nearly $4,200 per year and $125,000 over the life of the loan.

“Now is the time to encourage your buyers and sellers to jump into the market before it is too late.”

Since we believe that the interest rates are going to increase, now is the time to encourage your buyers and sellers to jump into the market before it is too late.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

What’s going on right now in our Phoenix area real estate market? Let’s examine the latest numbers and find out.

The latest numbers for our Phoenix metro real estate market are in, so let’s review them today. 

As of July, there were only 15,754 active listings in our residential market. This constitutes an 11.1% year-over-year decrease. Meanwhile, the number of pending listings also dropped—undergoing a 3.4% decrease from last year. 

Monthly median sales prices, though, have risen 9.4% since July of 2017, for a current median sale price of $267,990. 

In the new construction market, activity is booming. Yet with so few homes being built in the $200,000 and under price range, both resale and new construction homes within this bracket are seeing rapid appreciation. 

The market right now is very strong here in our Phoenix area, and it will likely continue to be so. With all of this in mind, you may be wondering what these conditions mean for those looking to buy or sell.

“The market right now is very strong here in our Phoenix area, and it will likely continue to be so.”

For sellers, it’s important to keep a pulse on how seasonal market trends may impact your goals. Conditions tend to lag slightly as we head into the fourth quarter, so being mindful of this change and strategizing your sale accordingly will be crucial to your success. 

For a buyer, it’s important to realize that interest rates are set to rise. That said, those thinking of buying should seize the opportunity to buy now while conditions are still favorable. 

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

What does Zillow&rsquo;s new Instant Offer program mean for Realtors? Today I will discuss how this change may impact you.

&nbsp;

Zillow has undergone some changes recently, so today I would like to talk about what is new with the site. If you visit Zillow’s website right now, you’ll probably notice that Realtors have been removed from every listing on the site. Now, instead of the name of an agent, the site is advertising their new Instant Offer program.

This program shows what Zillow will pay a homeowner for their property. Before, Zillow gave homeowners the opportunity to reach out to agents directly. Now, they are moving past that. This isn’t to say Zillow may not sell leads back to Realtors, but for now, the Instant Offer program has taken the place of agents on the site.

So, how is this affecting today’s Realtors? For one thing, it means that people who advertise heavily through Zillow, myself included, will no longer have the option to do so.

However, it is actually investors who will be most affected by this change. This is because Zillow will be getting the first crack at properties investors may have previously been the first to capture.

I also believe that this change will place Zillow in more direct competition with other platforms like Opendoor and OfferPad.

“Zillow will be getting the first crack at properties investors may have previously been the first to capture.”

It is important for Realtors to be aware of this change and how it may affect them. Staying informed is a critical aspect of any agent’s career. If you are concerned about this change, my recommendation is to focus on your past client database. Build deeper connections with people you have already formed relationships with.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Phoenix real estate is doing extremely well right now. Here’s what the latest numbers are telling us.

&nbsp;

The latest numbers are in and I’m excited to share them with you today. Let’s get right to it.

In March of this year, 9,402 homes closed escrow. In January, we only had 6,000 closed sales, which is still a strong number. This is one of the strongest first quarters we’ve seen in a while.

The market is up 36%, but inventory has dropped almost 12% at the same time. There are currently 21,703 homes active on the MLS today. The average list price is up 8.8% to $381,000 and the average sale price is up 9.5% to $316,400.

One of the most fascinating things I found was when looking at this year’s numbers compared to the numbers from the past 18 years. Back in 2001, the average price in the valley was $175,900. In 2007, the market roared to a peak of $345,900 before crashing and bottoming out in 2009 at $159,080. We’ve made a significant rebound since. Today, the average price is $316,365.

People who bought at the peak are close to being back where they were. People who bought 17 years ago have more than doubled their money, as have the people who bought at the bottom of the market.

“People who bought at the peak are seeing values rise back to where they were before.”

As an added note, I’ve seen more cranes in the sky in the Phoenix than I have in the last 10 years. High-rises, hotels, and more are being built all around the Valley, which is great news for our economy and ultimately, our market.

I hope your market is doing well. If you have any questions for me at all about the latest numbers or about the business in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

What&rsquo;s going on in the Phoenix real estate market? Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.

&nbsp;

Let’s talk about the hot, robust real estate market in Phoenix.

Last month alone, almost 17% of all homes that closed did so above list price. When it comes to buyers making offers on houses, you’ve got to make sure that you’re writing your offers very aggressively.

Only 3% of the upper-end homes actually got any type of seller concessions. When you get below $250,000, that’s still a pretty high percentage of sellers that will offer concessions. In that same price point, homes are selling way above list price as well.

We’ve experienced multiple offers on almost every home listed above $250,000. In preparing an offer, you want to come in with a higher earnest money deposit, short inspection time, few contingencies, and don’t ask for concessions.

“In this market, you need to come forward with your highest and best offer.”

When you’re representing the seller in today’s market, make sure that you’re studying the different buyers and talking to their lenders so that you can select the absolute best buyer possible. Again, in a hot market like today’s, when houses are selling above list price, you need to come forward with your highest and best offer.

Houses aren’t staying on the market very long. In fact, we have less than three months of inventory available, which is almost 18% lower than this time last year.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. If there is a topic you’d like me to discuss in a future video, send them my way; if I select yours, I’ll send you a $50 gift card to a restaurant of your choice.

I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

Today I’m joined by Sarah Michelle Bliss, who has been by my side for the last 20 years of my real estate career. She’s a great success coach, author, and real estate trainer. We’ve put together a great class on Thursday, July 26th from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. that we want to tell you about.

It’s called “10 Ways to Level Up Your Real Estate Business” and we will be walking you through a ton of information to help you become more proficient and get the most out of the hours that you are working.

The class is around three hours long, but it’s filled with content that will help you be more present at work and have more time off to enjoy life.

“We can’t wait for you to join us.”

As a bonus for being there, we’re also going to be giving you a copy of our 2018 business plan. It’s a complete business plan that takes you all the way through the steps it takes to build a successful real estate company.

Two of the buzzwords we use in our complete agent development are proactive and intentional. That’s where most agents struggle. They aren’t being consistent and proactive and completing the necessary activities to generate the results you want.

Space is limited so make sure you get signed up soon. You can register here.

If you have any questions about the class or the real estate business in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.

        <description>

Today, I have some advice on how you can handle multiple offer situations.

The Phoenix real estate market is absolutely on fire, and December 2017 was one of the busiest months of my career. Now that we’re in January of 2018, we’re getting multiple offers on just about every property that we place on the market. This affects the buyers possibly even more than the sellers.

“An escalation clause is a technique that may be necessary to get the house you want in this hot market.”

If you’re a buyer or representing a buyer in today’s marketplace, an escalation clause will help you beat out the current highest offer by offering a certain amount more. Essentially, it is a clause in the contract that says that the buyer is willing to pay X amount more than the highest offer received by the seller.  For example, let’s say you’re making an offer on a house priced at $400,000. You can put in an escalation clause that says you’ll outbid any other buyer by, say, $1,000. This might be a technique that is necessary to get the house that you want.

Inventory is still very low in the valley, but the demand is very high, so hopefully an escalation clause will help give you the edge you need to get the home of your dreams.

If you have any other questions about escalation clauses or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in our market, give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to help you.

        <description>

As you may remember, I did a video a couple of months ago on the book “Wealth Can’t Wait” by David Osborn and Paul Morris.

Around that same time, I had the pleasure of flying David in to give an hour-long talk on his book and how to build wealth. The information he shared was truly valuable and is sure to help you build wealth in your life.

“In his talk, David provides a lot of insight into how to build wealth.”

The next time you have an hour of free time, I’d like you to sit down and watch David’s presentation. You can find the video from that seminar here.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Over the last couple of months, I’ve heard the word “radon” too many times.

It’s interesting because whenever I talk to other real estate professionals, I ask them how many of the homes they’ve dealt with have had radon in them, and they always say, “None.”

Some buyers from the East Coast have some knowledge about radon, as do a few homeowners.

Radon came to my attention when I was representing a buyer during a transaction on a house in Scottsdale. This house had fallen out of escrow because the radon test came back two points higher than the national standard of 4%.

“If the house has a basement or underground air units, order a radon test.”

Radon is an odorless, poisonous gas that can cause lung cancer over long periods of exposure. As I’ve learned more about radon, I’ve found that the reason most people don’t find it in our area is that hardly anyone looks for it.

I was always taught that radon tests are necessary in mountainous regions because radon comes from granite in the ground. However, this Scottsdale house was on a flat piece of dirt and ended up having a high radon content.

We made the offer contingent on the seller getting radon levels down. At first, the seller paid $5,000 to fix the problem. The radon levels did not go down. The seller then spent another $5,000. After all the work they did and money they spent, the radon levels actually went higher, which was no good, and the buyer walked away.

I just want to make sure that people are aware that radon is out there. If you are buying a home, ask for a radon test. They only cost $300 to $350. If the house has a basement or underground air units, then you definitely need to order a radon test.

If you have any other questions about radon or buying a home, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

There are 14 vital activities that every real estate agent should do. Last time, we focused on the seven things you need to do to help sellers. Today, we’ll focus on what you need to do to master representing buyers.

1. Lead generation. Again, you need to be constantly generating new leads through open houses, Zillow, yard signs, and referrals from past clients, family, and friends.

2. Have a conversion process. What do you do to convert this person from a name and number into a buyer and broker contract?

3. Paperwork. Get that agreement signed and take care of agency disclosures and buyer advisories while you are in the beginning stages of working with the buyer.   

4. Finding and showing the perfect home. This is the fun part. You get to guide the buyer through their home search.

“You need to be able to write an offer that will get accepted.”

5. Writing and negotiating the best purchase agreement. You need to be proficient in making sure that your offers protect the buyer’s best interests. You also need to make sure that the buyer understands all of the inspections and finance contingencies. The bottom line is that you need to be able to write an offer that will be accepted.

6. Closing. Again, it’s important to make sure that the closing process goes smoothly. Be there with your buyer at the closing table in case they have any questions or concerns. You are there to be their advocate. Let them know that you care by showing up to closing. Then, when everything has been done, you can ask if there is anyone they can refer you to.

7. Post-closing activities. In my 31 years of real estate, I’ve noticed that this step gets skipped the most. What are you doing to develop a deep relationship with this client after you close escrow? After all, they may be a client who will bring you business for the rest of your life.

You need to have detailed plans in place to make sure that you are relevant in their mind. Call them up every now and then, invite them to sporting events, or host annual client appreciation events. You can also check to see how they like the house. If they have any challenges or need a repairman, you can put them in touch with one. You will position yourself as a great real estate resource.

I hope these 14 activities will help you grow your business. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

There are 14 vital activities that each Realtor should do. I’ll go over the first seven for you today.

1. Lead generation. It’s so important to constantly generate leads.

2. Converting leads. Turn those leads into appointments and then into contracts.

3. Administrative work. Most Realtors don’t like paperwork, which is why we have transaction coordinators to help us out. Administrative paperwork is a vital activity that we must do ourselves or delegate to others.

4. Have good presentation. It’s important to present at listing appointments, in front of buyers, and in the negotiation of contracts. Whether you are representing the buyer or seller, you have to be able to negotiate on their behalf.

5. Marketing. You need to have a strategic marketing plan in place. Whether you are trying to connect with people through farming, Zillow, or wherever it may be that you are spending money to generate leads, marketing is a highly important function of being a Realtor.

“There are many components that you need to master, but the closing component is extremely important.”

6. Closing. All of your hard work goes into the closing day. You want to make sure that you are able to get the closing done right. There are many components that you need to master, but the closing component is extremely important. Make sure you go to closings so that you can represent your client. By going to the closing, you will also be present in your client’s mindset and they will be more likely to send your information to their friends and family.

7. Post-closing activities. What do you do once the house is closed? Do you just cash the check and never talk to those people again? Or do you want these people to become part of the fabric of your life? It’s very important to have an ongoing follow-up plan for everyone you represent.

After all, if you had a good transaction, then they know, like, and trust you. They also know what to expect by working with you. Now it’s up to you to stay in constant contact with them. If they need help with the house, finding contractors, or dealing with home warranty issues, you should be their advocate. Invite them to dinner, call on them cordially after closing, or invite them to client events.

Stay tuned for the next seven tasks that every real estate agent should do. In the meantime, if you have any questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

Only a small percentage of agents make the most sales. Our team is part of that small percentage.

Join RE/MAX Professionals

Did you know that 14,904 homes sold yesterday alone? That’s straight from the National Association of Realtors.

In the Phoenix area, there are about 88,000 home sales per year. That breaks down to 7,400 each month and 275 each day. With over 35,000 Realtors in the Valley of the Sun, there are at least 26,000 Realtors who didn’t even sell a home last month.

How does this happen? As you may or may not know, a lot of licensed agents around here only work in real estate part-time. At Re/MAX Professionals, we focus on real estate as a full-time career. This is one of the reasons why our agents are able to sell 24 homes per year on average, the highest average in the Valley.

“There are at least 26,000 realtors who don’t sell a home each month.”

We train well, we pay well, and we support well. We have several events coming up soon. For one, we offer two real estate classes, called Momentum, each week. Momentum is all about mastering the basics. To learn more about Momentum, click here.



Also, I wan to remind you that I’m bringing in David Osborn, one of the authors of “Wealth Can’t Wait” on November 2nd. You’ll learn a lot and walk away with a free hardcover copy of David’s book. Learn more about the event here.



If you have any other questions for us in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

It’s pretty amazing to see some of the home buying numbers in the Hispanic community. Here are a few that stick out to us.

Join RE/MAX Professionals

The National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals has recently published a report that I wanted to talk about today. There are a lot of interesting numbers in here that point to an upward trend in Hispanic homeownership that no other demographic is seeing. Here’s what’s been going on:

• In 2016, there were 7.3 million Hispanic homeowners in the U.S.

• Also in 2016, there were 209,000 new Hispanic homeowners.

• Hispanic people account for 60% of the U.S.’s overall growth in homeownership.

• Hispanic people will account for 52% of new homeownership between 2010 and 2030.

• From 2010 to 2015, Hispanics accounted for more than half the population growth in the U.S. according to the U.S. Census.

• Six out of 10 Hispanic homebuyers are millennials.

• The Hispanic purchasing power was $1.4 trillion in 2016—more than the entire country of Australia.

• Hispanic people account for 76.4% of labor growth.

In addition to these numbers, you can see a graph in the video above that shows the growth in owner-occupied units. You can see the Hispanic population of homeowners start to increase over the last decade or so now that growth has outpaced that of non-Hispanic homeowners.

Another graph in the video above shows the net homeownership change. It’s interesting to note that Hispanics had an additional 1.1 million homeownership changes from 2010 to 2016, while non-Hispanic homeownership changes went down by 2.2 million.

“Hispanic homeownership is at an all-time high.”

Some of these stats just absolutely blew me away. After reading into them more, it makes sense. As far as Hispanic attitudes toward homeownership are concerned, raising a family and wealth creation have proven to be the primary drivers. It appears that trend is likely to continue.

Before I go, I wanted to quickly remind you that I’m bringing in David Osborn, one of the authors of “Wealth Can’t Wait” on November 2nd. You’ll walk away with a free hardcover copy of David’s book. Learn more about the event here.

What does it take to master your craft? Today, I’ve got a few stories on this subject as well as a few opportunities you should know about that can help.

Join RE/MAX Professionals

Right now, my family and I are taking a trip up to Jackson Hole, Wyoming for the total solar eclipse. But today, I wanted to talk to you about something different—mastering your craft.

When it comes to mastering your craft, one story that comes to mind for me is that of my mentor: Howard Brinton. When it comes to becoming a surgeon, mastering your craft is an absolute necessity. Between college, med school, and practicing on cadavers, a lot of time and hard work goes into it.

But, there are many ways you can master your craft. When it comes to real estate, the 90 minutes it takes to get your license isn’t where the fine-tuning ends. In real estate, experience with real clients is the best way to master your craft.

In fact, experience is a great way to hone your skills in any endeavor. As a kid, Kurt Warner, who was just inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame, would practice every single day. He continued this through high school, college, and beyond. Even still, success doesn’t always come that simply.

Kurt was cut after being drafted by the Green Bay Packers. He didn’t make the team, but kept practicing anyway. After gaining even more experience through arena football and even playing in Europe, he was contacted by the St. Louis Rams. Then when he started playing with them, he took the team to the Super Bowl—and they won.

No matter what your passion is, it will take a lot of time to master it. As a real estate agent, you can master your craft by practicing scripts, listing presentations, and buyer presentations. If you want to be great at what you do, you’ve got to practice daily.

I want to help. If you’re looking to further yourself in your real estate career, I’d like to sit down with you and speak one-on-one about how you can master your craft.

For me, becoming skilled at what I do is something I’ve always strived for. As a child my hero was Bruce Lee. Seeing his statue was one of the reasons I took my recent trip to Hong Kong. Bruce Lee has been an inspiration to me, and many of the things he’s said still resonate with me, today. One quote of his in particular stands out: “I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.”

“Experience with real clients is the best way to master your craft.”

This is true not just of martial arts, but of any skill. To become truly masterful over what you do, you must put in a lot of time. As a real estate professional, there are a lot of events out there designed to help you master your craft.

At RE/MAX Professionals, we have several events coming up, ourselves. For one, we offer two real estate classes, called Momentum, each week. Momentum is all about mastering the basics. To learn more about Momentum, click here.



We’re also excited to announce that we will be hosting a special guest speaker, David Osborn, on November 2nd, 2017. David is going to share his story with us. After college, he took a year off to backpack around the world. After coming back to help his mom with her real estate endeavors, David now owns one of the nation’s largest real estate firms.

Along with his story, David will also be speaking about his most recent book, “Wealth Can’t Wait.” On that note, we have exciting news. The first 200 people who sign up will receive a copy of David’s book on us. For more information about this event, click here. 



If you’ve got any questions you’d like me to answer, send it in. If we use your question in one of our videos, I’ll send you out a $50 gift certificate.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Today I have some interesting statistics about real estate agents in the Valley, and an opportunity for those Realtors who want to improve their numbers.

Join RE/MAX Professionals

There are almost 38,000 active licenses in the Valley today that are Realtors, plus additional non-Realtor licenses as well. There are over 4,200 real estate offices in the Valley.

One interesting statistic that stands out to me is that 15% of active agents have left the business after just one year. That’s about 5,700 agents who no longer have a license.

10% of agents, or about 3,800, are only in business for 24 to 36 months. After three years in the business, an additional 5% of the remaining agents leave. So once you’ve made it past four years in the business, you can expect to be doing pretty well.

“Once you’ve made it past four years, you can expect to be doing pretty well.”

Throughout 2016, the number of homes sold in the Valley was 88,713. Given the current number of agents that are active, that’s only 2.36 homes per agent! Our agents at RE/MAX Professionals sell 10 times that average. Some of our agents have sold over 100 homes in the last year.

So if you have any questions on how to become a better real estate agent, we offer free training to anyone interested. You don’t have to join our company, but we would love to see you come through. We’ve created a better business model that focuses on helping regular agents become legendary agents.

If you have any questions about our free training, please give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to help!

Everyone’s life is a different journey. However, if you start forming these habits now, your journey will lead to wealth.

Join RE/MAX Professionals

Today’s topic is right out of the book “Wealth Can’t Wait” by David Osborn and Paul Morris. I know these gentlemen personally and was very excited to read their book. In it, I found a ton of helpful, useful information on creating wealth. One of the things that stuck out to me the most was the list of seven habits that create wealth.

1. Live by design. Think about how you want your life to be and create a plan to get there.

2. Make business decisions based on a solid foundation and solid fundamentals.

3. Stick with what you know and drill in deep. Our wealth should be built through our biggest competency.

4. Earn more by learning more. I probably go to more seminars than most Realtors, and I believe they have helped me immensely in my career. There’s always something new you can learn.

“My constant education has helped me immensely in my career.”

5. Break down your big goals into smaller ones and add accountability.

6. Spend less than you earn and invest the rest.

7. Let go of the small stuff. We need to think and act bigger than that.

This is just one of the many helpful passages I picked up by reading “Wealth Can’t Wait.” If you have any questions about the book, would like to discuss it further, or want to discuss your real estate career, give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you.

Property acquisition companies have been around for a long time in our market, but we are just now starting to see more online-only companies. Today, I’ve listed three of the most popular.

Join RE/MAX Professionals

Today I wanted to talk to you about three companies based solely online that are interrupting our real estate market in the Phoenix metro area.

1. Open Door has been around for the last couple of years, and it’s a pretty fascinating company to say the least. I can tell you that they aren’t going away anytime soon. They have an extraordinary management team and are valued at $550 million. They have $110 million in cash equity to buy properties, and have in total $180 million to acquire properties and run this platform.

I’m currently representing a buyer who is looking to purchase a home through this site and it’s been an interesting experience. As far as I know, Phoenix was one of their first test markets, and they seem to be successful so far.

2. OfferPad is an online application that helps you sell your home quickly and efficiently. It was started by a local Realtor and a gentleman from Blackstone in 2005, and they have $260 million in debt acquisition money and $30 million in equity.

Due to one of the founder’s developed business models, this company is expanding to multiple cities at a faster rate than Open Door. They’ve captured a 2% market share in the Phoenix metro area.

3. Zillow is a well-known company that has seen a lot of controversy over their Zestimate feature. They also have an Instant Offer Program that is being tested in Las Vegas and Orlando. It’s set up for big investor pools to directly buy homes from homeowners.

“These companies have been around for a long time.”

There’s been some play to keep the agent involved in these transactions, but I’m sure that at some point those parties will work to find a way around paying a commission to the agent.

Both Open Door and OfferPad are buying houses and advertising their ease of use. They claim to take the pain out of selling your home, and their popularity speaks for itself. What’s interesting is that both those apps also charge a commission for acquisitions that sits between 6% and 10%, depending on the risk factor.

These types of companies have been around for a long time in the direct investor-to-homeowner market. We’ve seen their yellow signs at street lights that say “I’ll buy your house for cash,” or something similar. We’re just now seeing the online model move forward.

I’d love to have your opinion about these online real estate companies. Do you think they’re going to “Uber-ize” the market? Will there be less need for agents? Shoot me an email or leave a comment below with your thoughts.

If you have any other questions about this or any other real estate topics, give me a call. I’d be happy to help!

What are the best practices for prospecting? We’ve got a great study from MIT about this topic to share with you today.

Join RE/MAX Professionals

I’ve got some great information to share today that I recently came across. A study conducted by MIT and published in the Harvard Business Review examined a number of different factors relating to response times for lead management. They collected more than 15,000 Internet leads in a three-year period and reached out to more than 100,000 different people in order to find the best times for getting responses.

Although every day is a good day to make contact, the study found that you have the best odds of reaching someone on either a Wednesday or a Thursday. There was a 49% difference between calling on Thursday versus calling on Tuesday.

As for the best time to make contact, the best results were found within the 3:30 to 5:30 p.m. time period. The next best time to call would be between 8 p.m. and 9 a.m. The difference between calling at 1:00 p.m. versus calling at 4 p.m. is 164%.

“You have the best odds of converting leads within five minutes of capturing them.”

You’ve probably heard before that making contact with prospects is all about timeliness. In fact, you do have the greatest odds of converting leads within the first five minutes of capturing them. After that, the conversion percentage decreases by 10 times. You absolutely have to respond to these leads as soon as they come in. There is more than a 400% difference between responding within five minutes and responding within 10.

Another thing this study showed was that persistence is key. When making calls, the likelihood of conversion increases greatly after about the sixth call. Continuing to call and being persistent with your leads is another simple way to ensure the success of your real estate business.

If you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. If you’d just like to sit down and have a chat about your career, I’d be happy to help with that as well. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
