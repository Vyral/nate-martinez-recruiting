<p>Dear Fellow Real Estate Agent,</p>

<p>We understand that you may be frustrated right now with your current brokerage or place of work. Perhaps you feel as if you aren’t receiving much, if any, support in building the wealth and the life you deserve. You might lack the training, coaching, and mentoring to get you there.</p>

<p>Many new agents are overwhelmed with all the information in real estate school. There’s pressure to choose a broker immediately after getting your license and it’s hard to know whether you’ll be able to earn the income necessary. Maybe you’re afraid of not having that work/life balance that you need, or you simply don’t know what it will take for you to gain success.</p>

<p>If any of this sounds like you, you aren’t alone. <strong>In fact, 87% of new real estate agents fail within 10 months.</strong> In Arizona, 53,000 of the 85,000 licensed agents only sold one house last year. They either run out of money or don’t have the support or structure needed to be successful in this business long term. An agent needs many things in order to be successful, including training, support, coaching with accountability, structure, and leads.</p>

<p>Going into real estate can feel either like the best or the worst career move you’ve ever made. So, how can you be sure that your real estate career won’t end in disaster and you won’t have to return to the soul-sucking job that you left? You join a quality brokerage—one with the right resources, training, and culture to help you grow as an agent.</p>

<p><strong>With the proper tools, your real estate career can go from barely surviving to absolutely thriving.</strong> We have those tools here at RE/MAX Professionals. Since 2002, we have been training, coaching, and producing at an extremely high level. The experience, passion, and integrity of our owners ensures that our agents are supported. Our enduring commitment to real estate excellence is not only for the benefit of our valued clients, but for the benefit of our agents as well.</p>

<p>Whether you are a new agent, an experienced one, or are just thinking of entering the world of real estate, we can help you. <strong>If you have a strong work ethic and you’re looking to make a career in real estate and start earning income right away, here’s what we’ll provide for you:</strong>
<ul class="indent">
<li>In-house coaching services</li>
<li>A 14-class intro series, “Complete Agent Development”</li>
<li>Proven training and systems that we will teach you how to implement</li>
<li>Assistance with creating a business plan that holds you accountable</li>
<li>Consistently strong leads</li>
<li>Twice a year business consultations</li>
<li>Monthly meetings</li>
<li>Agent Masterminds</li>
<li>Weekly Classes </li>
</ul></p>

<p>By joining us at RE/MAX Professionals, you’ll be on the fast track to success. If you want to be successful, there is a huge opportunity here in our culture of giving.</p>

<p>You can go work for HomeSmart, but you won’t get the same type of support and culture that you’ll get with us.</p>

<p>You can try to work as an independent agent, but you won’t get any training, coaching, or support. This will likely lead to low production.</p>

<p>However, If you give us a call today, we’ll help you identify your career goals and your “why”, we’ll help you write a business plan tailored to your specific leads, and we’ll help you implement that plan accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>If you join our team and you’re willing to be accountable, we guarantee that you’ll find success.</strong> We have the highest production per agent than any other company in the valley and we rank 32nd nationwide. Our average agent sides at 22 units. RE/MAX opens many doors of opportunity to agents who are willing to put in the time and effort.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you may be interested in having a look at some of our most frequently asked questions like, “What are your monthly fees?” or “What kind of coaching and training do you offer?”</p>

<p>We can answer those questions for you and any other questions you may have about our team if you just give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon and we look forward to helping you take your career in real estate to the next level.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Nate Martinez & Sarah Michelle Bliss</p>
