In his free time, Nate enjoys spending quality time with his family – fiancée Tonya, their two year old daughter Mila and his two older children, Brandi and Nathan Jr. He is an avid sports enthusiastic, loves attending concerts and practicing his golf swing when he is not “tweeting” a new restaurant review. Nate’s personal and professional philosophy is a quote from the great Wayne Gretzky, “skate to where the puck is going, not where it’s been!”</p>
