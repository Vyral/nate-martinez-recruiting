<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales.</p>

<p><strong>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</strong></p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<p>My name is Nate Martinez and we've sold over 5000 homes year to date. </p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>I also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate and sales.</p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who want to sell their home who list with you.</p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p class="quote">"I have been with RE/MAX Professionals for 11 years, with a 2 year break when I joined another company. During that time, I realized how advanced in training, staff support and education RE/MAX Professionals truly is. Our company always excels in providing valuable tools for our own business growth, from how to use the RE/MAX brand to our benefit, to the weekly training courses, to keeping us updated on industry changes and developments. With an amazing full time staff and transaction coordinator services, we are able to sell more real estate successfully and efficiently. I love the internal support among the agents as well ~ we are happy to share our "secrets" with each other, giving advice and encouragement along the way. Joining (and returning to) RE/MAX Professionals is the best business decision I've ever made!"</p>

<p class="quote">"I work for RE/MAX Professionals because of the support and training they offer every agent, for free! I've taken every Momentum course and it's given me a solid foundation to grow my business the right way! They even have some free continuing education classes. The best thing is the people! All of our agents what everyone to succeed and they'll help you along the way."</p>

<p class="quote">“Surround yourself with Successful People and You, Yourself, will be come Successful!" At RE/MAX Professionals, the owners and agents share their success ideas. They truly care. I came from a 25 year corporate background and have built a successful real estate career beyond what I thought was possible. I no longer think with limits. Success is yours if you put yourself in a place to grow. I could not imagine being anywhere else.”</p>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working at our brokerage.</p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p><strong>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me.</strong> We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Nate Martinez</p>
